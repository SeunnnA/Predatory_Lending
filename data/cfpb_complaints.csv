Everything went as planned with the monthly payments, until I made my last payment of {$29.00} on XX/XX/XXXX. After, I had made my last payment on the XXXX, I personally contacted this company at XXXX, and had a gentleman check to see if I had anymore loans outstanding. The gentleman on the other line stated no, so the representative processed my payment, as well as sent me payoff letter through my personal email. Now, as I previously mentioned I paid this balance in full on XX/XX/XXXX, or so I thought, all the while this same company mailed out another collection letter, on XX/XX/XXXX asking for the same amount, with different account numbers plus the following payoff options : Monthly payments of $ XXXX towards balance of {$1200.00} ( Discount ) One-time payment of {$600.00} ( Discount ) Immediately, after receiving second letter I called, and spoke to representative. Then, once representative answered I stated : "" I am calling because I just received another letter, stating I again owe {$1200.00}, and that I thought this balance was taken care of on XX/XX/XXXX. '' I also reminded the representative that someone checked on XX/XX/XXXX, and had told me that I did not have anymore loans. This representative stated that the other person had made a mistake, and had not looked up in the left hand corner of my account. I replied that is not right to the representative, then I asked when was I supposed to take this other loan out, and the representative stated XXXX of XXXX. At, this time, I am very frustrated and proceeded to hang up on this individual. Next, I decided to call XXXX XXXX directly at XXXX, then proceeded to talk to live representative, then proceeded to tell representative the story, the female representative then asked for my first and last name as well as my last four of social. She looked in her system and the replied that there was no record of me, ever taking out loan with them. Then, I gave her my first, middle, and last name, her system again did not pull up anything.

While you maintain that my loan is governed solely by tribal law, this does not exempt you from complying with XXXX XXXX consumer protection laws. XXXX XXXX has a strict usury cap of 30 % APR on personal loans, and courts have repeatedly ruled that state lending laws apply to loans made to residents of that state, regardless of a lenders tribal affiliation. Furthermore, multiple federal and state lawsuits have determined that tribal lending entities can not automatically shield themselves from state regulations when lending to non-tribal residents. 

The fact that XXXX forgave my remaining balance suggests an acknowledgment that the interest rates were excessive and potentially unenforceable. However, this does not resolve the fact that I overpaid due to the unlawful interest rates applied to my loan. Therefore, I continue to request a refund of the excessive interest I was charged, which amounts to approximately $ XXXX {$1000.00} or more. 

If XXXX  maintains its refusal to issue a refund, I will have no choice but to escalate this matter further, including but not limited to : Filing a complaint with the XXXX XXXX Division of Consumer Affairs and the XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX 

Exploring legal action or joining class-action lawsuits against unlawful tribal lending practices.

I signed up for an account on XXXX, and expected to see the usual Loan Contracts with interest rates and fees, basically the loan contract except I did not see it. I saw XXXX documents that I had to sign, but none of the documents I signed had any loan information that I was seeking. 

I called and spoke to a rep from XXXX, and she said not to worry, that as soon as I sign the documents, there would be a loan contract complete with all the information I need to make a decision on whether to proceed with the loan. The rep specifically stated that the loan will not be finalized until I agree to the loan contract which would be emailed to me. 

I signed the XXXX documents electronically and waited for the loan contract to be sent to my email. 

A few hours later, I see a deposit for {$XXXX} into my account, which I did not ask for nor authorize. I did not even have any information about the loan, why would I authorize this transaction? I checked my email to see if the contract came through, and I did not find anything. I went to my account on the XXXX website, and could not find any terms or conditions of my loan there either. 

I called and spoke with a rep and they explained I would have to mail the company to get a copy of the contract.

Amount Deducted : Two unauthorized transactions of {$170.00} each, totaling {$340.00}.

Potential Wage Theft Violation : Since these deductions were taken directly from my account after my loan was paid in full, they may constitute a form of wage theft. These deductions were unauthorized and unjust, directly impacting my earnings and financial well-being.

The following are specific issues we have encountered : 1. Harassment Through Excessive Calls Tower Loan calls multiple times a day, often back-to-back.

Employees use their personal phone numbers to contact us.

2. Unlawful Disclosure of Debt to Third Parties They have called and discussed our debt with family members and friends, demanding payment.

3. False Threats of Legal Action They continuously threaten legal action they do not intend to take.

4. Unfair and Unlawful Payment Requirements They require payments to be made only in cash, in person, and in-store, which is restrictive and unreasonable.

5. Lack of Transparency and Inaccurate Accounting The branch manager was unable to provide a total amount we have paid to date.

When we attempted to check our account online, it stated that we do not have an active account with original account number.

* They have created multiple account numbers. 
* Loan was opened XX/XX/year> XXXX. XXXX XXXX Tower Loan employees have come to our home and discussed our debt in front of our neighbors and children, causing embarrassment and distress. 
7. Discrepancies in Loan Payments and Balance Owed We originally took out a {$4000.00} loan from Tower Loan. 
According to our bank statements, we have paid a total of {$4800.00}, not including multiple cash payments made at the branch. 
Despite having repaid well over {$6000.00}, Tower Loan states that we still owe {$5000.00}, which is inconsistent and suggests predatory lending or improper accounting practices. 

This situation has caused extreme stress for my family and me. Tower Loans conduct appears to violate multiple provisions of the FDCPA, including excessive harassment, third-party disclosure, misleading statements, and unfair debt collection practices.

MyPay is a cash advance option given based on your income. The amount you can advance usually starts at {$100.00} the fist month and will increase going forward one your income is re-evaluated. I originally was offered {$100.00} and it was repaid out of my next deposit. Going forward the amount increased every month until I reached the max of {$500.00} last month. This is where the deception started. This month my direct deposit went into my account and Chime was repaid their {$500.00} I was advanced in XXXX. After they were repaid the MyPay advance amount changed to {$300.00} which I understand because my income decreased however out of the {$300.00} I was offered I was only allowed to access {$25.00} on the fist day. The 2nd day I was only offered {$13.00} which doesn't even make sense because they have a {$20.00} minimum for their MyPay advance. Their terms for MyPay states that on day ONE of the advance being repaid they will allow you to access the amount equivalent to 2 days of the the deposit amount. In my case two days would be {$62.00} but I was only offered {$25.00}. Their system makes NO sense at all! in XXXX when the advance amountwas at {$300.00}, I was able to access {$200.00} on the first day. But somehow in XXXX I can only access {$25.00} of the {$300.00} advance offered, Their practices and calculations simply don't make sense at all. I have seen this same complaint online from at least XXXX of Chime 's customers and in almost every complaint, the issues start around month 3-4 of using MyPay. The fact that they repay themselves the full {$500.00} I used the month before, then offer {$300.00}, which I understand because of my pay decrease, but to then ONLY offer {$25.00} after they've repaid themselves {$500.00} without even a heads up actually puts their customers in a WORSE situation. They aren't even honoring their terms by allowing the 2 day worth of your income as your first withdrawal on day one of the repayment, is deceptive. After I repay this advance and and anything else I owe them, I am closing this account. I can't afford to repay {$500.00} and then only be able to get {$25.00}. Had they made it CLEAR that the daily amount accessible doesn't even equate to the {$20.00} minimum they require for an advance, I wouldn't have used it because I would have known this was a product that I wouldn't want to use. My regular account at the Credit Union allows a {$500.00} cash advance until your next payday however once you repay, you then have access to ALL of whatever amount they offer. No one can make a plan that works to pay their bills the next month when you have NO clue what Chime will allow you to access of the My Pay advance. It's a horrible, predatory product that they lure you into and then unexpectedly the everything changes and there is just no way of knowing what those changes will be. I know that their terms and conditions explain the advance amount can change based on income but it is NOT clear that the amount available each day changes. If you offer someone {$300.00} to use, let them use it especially since Chime has taken ALL that's owed to them. It doesn't help a customer to repay a {$500.00} loan and then offer them {$25.00} or {$13.00} a day until you get to {$300.00}.

I expressed several times over a extended period of time that I was in the store front, that I was cancelling the loan. I even expressed that if they would NOT take it and giver proof of payment that I in fact did not owe the money. After what seemed like hours in the store front in effort to resolve the issue.

I explained this to them when getting the loan and I was told not to worry, they would withdraw it when payment was due.

I also told them every time they called that I signed for the payments to be automatically withdrawn and to please do that- do not call me at work as this can get me fired. They never collected payment even after telling them to do so. The last time I spoke to someone I told them that I signed up for automatic withdrawal for a reason and to please just take the payments out and stop calling me. They said okay. A few months later I got a letter stating that they were intending to send me to court for non-payment. I called and asked why they never took the payments out and explained that I had tried to make payments but it was an inconvenience with my job and location to physically go to the store, and that I signed up for automatic withdrawl directly from my bank account for a reason. I offered to pay the full amount of {$860.00} and some change in 3 payments and they refused. Now they're taking me to court.

01/22/25,"Payday loan, title loan, personal loan, or advance loan",Payday loan,Struggling to pay your loan,None,"I am writing to formally address concerns regarding the management of my account and to request immediate action to resolve ongoing issues. In XX/XX/XXXX, I made two payments toward my loan, which should have fully covered that months obligations. Despite this, I have not received any updates confirming these payments or reflecting them on my account. 

Additionally, I contacted your office in XX/XX/XXXX, to seek clarification on my account status and to address concerns about communication. During that call, I was informed that I had signed a document declining text messages. While this may apply to non-essential communications, it does not negate the agencys responsibility to provide critical updates regarding my account as part of your fiduciary duty. As a loan holder, I rely on timely and accurate account information, which was not provided. 

The agent, a female agent, I spoke with assured me that she would return my phone call to resolve the matter. However, no such follow-up occurred, highlighting a concerning lack of communication and responsiveness on BMG Moneys part. This failure to communicate has left me without the necessary information to manage my account effectively, potentially jeopardizing my financial standing. 

Given these circumstances, I am requesting that my XX/XX/XXXX payments be placed on hold or deferred to the end of the loan term. This adjustment will provide me the flexibility needed to complete XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX which I previously informed your office about. It is imperative that the agency recognizes the financial strain this situation has caused and acts accordingly to provide relief. 

Furthermore, I urge BMG Money to improve its communication practices. As a financial institution, it is your obligation to maintain clear and consistent communication with your customers, especially when addressing issues related to loan management. The lack of a callback after my inquiry is unacceptable and must be addressed to prevent similar instances in the future. 

Please confirm receipt of this correspondence and advise on the next steps to resolve these concerns. I trust that BMG Money will address this matter promptly and work with me to reach a fair and equitable resolution.
