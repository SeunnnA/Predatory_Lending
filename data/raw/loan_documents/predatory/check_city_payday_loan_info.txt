The Benefits of Check City Loans

Spanish Version
5 Star Excellence award from Shopper Approved for collecting at least 100 5 star reviews
With a short-term loan from a reputable lender, you can avoid paying late, overdraft, over-the-limit, and reconnection fees. Avoiding these fees might even help protect your credit score from the negative impact these fees can have.

A payday advance also gives you access to fast cash, so you can take advantage of great sales or limited-time offers that you would otherwise miss if you waited until your next paycheck.

Frequently Asked Questions
What is a payday loan?

Check City holds the check until your next payday or some other date you specify and then cashes the check to repay the loan.

Is Check City a direct payday lender?
Yes! Check City is licensed and registered in each state where it operates and is the direct lender of your loan (with the exception of Texas where we are licensed as a Credit Service Organization. We service your loan through an affiliated short-term loan provider). That means if we approve your loan it will be issued and serviced by Check City. 

What is an ACH transaction?
ACH Transaction stands for an Automatic Clearing House Transaction. It is a method of electronically depositing or withdrawing funds from an account. If your paycheck is directly deposited into your account, it is done by ACH.

How much can I borrow?
Loan amounts are determined on an individual basis. Your credit limit will depend on a number of factors—like your monthly income, how much you’ve already borrowed, and other creditworthiness factors. 

Many states have limits on the loan amount you can borrow. For more information please check the Annual Percentage Rate Disclosure for your state.

What are the rates and terms?
The total cost of credit is always clearly outlined to you according to the Federal Truth in Lending Regulations. You will find all the information about the Annual Percentage Rate (APR), the finance charge, the interest rate, and the total amount you are required to repay in the terms and conditions of your loan agreement. 

Late fees, returned item/NSF fees, or ongoing interest may apply if you fail to pay your loan on time. 

We will not charge you hidden fees that are not fully disclosed in your loan agreement. Visit our rates and fees page for information about rates in your state.

Can I make a partial payment?
A borrower may make partial payments on the principal owed on the loan without incurring additional charges.

Can I pay off my loan early?
Yes, you can make prepayments and partial payments on a loan. 

If you decide you do not want your loan within 24 hours of being approved, you may rescind your loan at no charge as long as you return the loan proceeds in accordance with the terms listed in your loan agreement. 

We encourage you to reduce the principal of your loan by making early payments to potentially reduce the finance charges you may incur at refinance.

How do I pay the loan back?
There are several options for paying back your loan. You can pay in person, over the phone, with cash, or with a *debit card if you don’t want the check deposited. You can pay back the loan online through an automatic withdraw directly from your bank account.

*Certain conditions and restrictions may apply. Please contact a Customer Service Representative at (800) 404-0254 for details.

How long does it take to approve my loan and receive the funds?
Once you’ve filled out the application the loan approval process only takes a few minutes for an in-store loan application. Getting the loan approved and having cash in hand usually only takes about 15 minutes.

For an online loan application, you can expect your funds to drop into your account within one business day of being approved. Please see your loan disclosure for specific details.

Is it easy to get additional loans?
After successfully completing your first payday advance loan, additional loans are easy to request. Simply go back to any Check City location and request a new loan. 

We remind consumers that payday advances should be used for short-term financial needs only and not as a long-term financial solution. Consumers who are experiencing credit difficulties should seek credit counseling. In addition, some states require a cooling-off period between payday loans or otherwise restrict the frequent supply of payday loans to a consumer. 

For additional information regarding your state’s governance on cash advance loans please contact a Check City Customer Service Representative.
