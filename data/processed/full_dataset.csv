We may also ask for your driver’s license number or other identifying documents.

Business Day means Monday through Friday excluding all federal banking holidays. The loan documents and authorizations, including the loan agreement, depend on time-sensitive factors. Despite our best efforts, unavoidable delays in the review process can happen. If we are unable to verify your information within two Business Days after you submit your application, the loan documents and authorizations may need to be modified to accurately reflect certain payment disclosures, and you may be required to carefully review and submit new documents reflecting these changes.

** Returned payments, late payments, and non-payments may result in additional fees, charges, or collection activities pursuant to the terms of your loan agreement and as allowable under Tribal and applicable federal law.

The Benefits of Check City Loans

Spanish Version
5 Star Excellence award from Shopper Approved for collecting at least 100 5 star reviews
With a short-term loan from a reputable lender, you can avoid paying late, overdraft, over-the-limit, and reconnection fees. Avoiding these fees might even help protect your credit score from the negative impact these fees can have.

A payday advance also gives you access to fast cash, so you can take advantage of great sales or limited-time offers that you would otherwise miss if you waited until your next paycheck.

Frequently Asked Questions
What is a payday loan?
A payday loan is an advance on your next paycheck. You take out a small, short-term loan and repay it when you receive your next paycheck. By doing this you can get the funds you need from your next paycheck sooner.

Payday Loans should be used for short-term financial needs only, not as a long-term financial solution. If you are experiencing credit difficulties, we encourage you to seek credit counseling. Although we strive to assist every applicant, not all loan applications will be approved.

Check City holds the check until your next payday or some other date you specify and then cashes the check to repay the loan.

Is Check City a direct payday lender?
Yes! Check City is licensed and registered in each state where it operates and is the direct lender of your loan (with the exception of Texas where we are licensed as a Credit Service Organization. We service your loan through an affiliated short-term loan provider). That means if we approve your loan it will be issued and serviced by Check City. 

What is an ACH transaction?
ACH Transaction stands for an Automatic Clearing House Transaction. It is a method of electronically depositing or withdrawing funds from an account. If your paycheck is directly deposited into your account, it is done by ACH.

What do I need to bring?
Basic customer contact information (name, phone number, email address)
Proof of Income (paystub, awards letter, bank statement)
State or Federal ID 
Checking account
How much can I borrow?
Loan amounts are determined on an individual basis. Your credit limit will depend on a number of factors—like your monthly income, how much you’ve already borrowed, and other creditworthiness factors. 

Many states have limits on the loan amount you can borrow. For more information please check the Annual Percentage Rate Disclosure for your state.

What are the rates and terms?
The total cost of credit is always clearly outlined to you according to the Federal Truth in Lending Regulations. You will find all the information about the Annual Percentage Rate (APR), the finance charge, the interest rate, and the total amount you are required to repay in the terms and conditions of your loan agreement. 

Late fees, returned item/NSF fees, or ongoing interest may apply if you fail to pay your loan on time. 

We will not charge you hidden fees that are not fully disclosed in your loan agreement. Visit our rates and fees page for information about rates in your state.

Can I make a partial payment?
A borrower may make partial payments on the principal owed on the loan without incurring additional charges.

Can I pay off my loan early?
Yes, you can make prepayments and partial payments on a loan. 

If you decide you do not want your loan within 24 hours of being approved, you may rescind your loan at no charge as long as you return the loan proceeds in accordance with the terms listed in your loan agreement. 

We encourage you to reduce the principal of your loan by making early payments to potentially reduce the finance charges you may incur at refinance.

How do I pay the loan back?
There are several options for paying back your loan. You can pay in person, over the phone, with cash, or with a *debit card if you don’t want the check deposited. You can pay back the loan online through an automatic withdraw directly from your bank account.

*Certain conditions and restrictions may apply. Please contact a Customer Service Representative at (800) 404-0254 for details.

How long does it take to approve my loan and receive the funds?
Once you’ve filled out the application the loan approval process only takes a few minutes for an in-store loan application. Getting the loan approved and having cash in hand usually only takes about 15 minutes.

For an online loan application, you can expect your funds to drop into your account within one business day of being approved. Please see your loan disclosure for specific details.

Is it easy to get additional loans?
After successfully completing your first payday advance loan, additional loans are easy to request. Simply go back to any Check City location and request a new loan. 

We remind consumers that payday advances should be used for short-term financial needs only and not as a long-term financial solution. Consumers who are experiencing credit difficulties should seek credit counseling. In addition, some states require a cooling-off period between payday loans or otherwise restrict the frequent supply of payday loans to a consumer. 

For additional information regarding your state’s governance on cash advance loans please contact a Check City Customer Service Representative.

Online payday loan alternatives from CashNetUSA.
When people are in a pinch for fast funding, they may look for bad credit loans to address their needs. For example, they might seek a cash advance, no credit check loan, emergency loan, title loan or payday loan.

CashNetUSA doesn’t offer title loans or payday loans, but we do offer lines of credit and installment loans. And we can offer them without performing a hard credit check with any of the main credit bureaus. Instead, we conduct an alternative credit check that uses other sources of data such as Clarity. Because of this, applying with us will not affect your FICO® credit score.

Loans from CashNetUSA offer greater flexibility than payday loans. With our line of credit, you receive access to a set amount of funds that you can access as needed. With our installment loan, you receive a one-time lump sum that you repay gradually over time.

To learn if our funding options are available in your state, check out our Rates & Terms page.

How do payday loans compare with installment loans?
Payday loans and installment loans both provide a lump sum of money. However, installment loans are repaid gradually in “installments,” while payday loans typically need to be repaid in a single payment.

Loan amounts and the length of the repayment period also differ. Installment loans almost always offer bigger amounts and longer repayment periods compared to payday loans.


How do payday loans compare with lines of credit?
Rather than getting one lump sum of money, a line of credit provides a specific amount of credit that can be withdrawn as needed. It's repaid based on what’s been borrowed.

There’s a minimum payment due for each billing cycle (based on outstanding principal and fees). Unlike payday loans, you can make partial payments over time, or repay in full to reduce interest. As you repay, the money becomes available to draw from again.

Can I get a loan with no credit check?
Some lenders can offer loans without performing a traditional credit check. Instead of determining creditworthiness from your traditional credit report, these lenders may verify your income, employment status and bank account information. Whether you can get a loan would then depend largely on those factors — especially having verifiable income to show you can repay the loan.

More commonly, lenders may perform a “soft credit check,” which is a credit check that doesn’t leave a hard credit inquiry on your FICO credit report. Here are some ways to improve your financial picture — regardless of if you’re able to get a loan with no credit check:

Build or repair your credit. By improving your credit history, you can qualify for better loans with lower interest rates in the future.

Explore government assistance programs. Some government programs offer financial assistance that may help you avoid high-interest loans.

Talk to a financial advisor. Find a free credit counselor or advisor that can help you explore other options and create a plan to manage your finances better.


What type of loan is easiest to get with bad credit?
When you have bad credit, getting approved for loans can be challenging, but some types of loans are easier to obtain than others.

Online Personal Loans

Some online lenders offer installment loans or lines of credit for borrowers with bad credit. These loans may provide longer and more flexible repayment structures, which can make them more manageable compared to payday loans.

Secured Loans

Secured loans are backed by collateral, which reduces the lender's risk. Those typically include title loans, secured credit cards, secured personal loans and home equity lines of credit.

Credit Union Loans

Credit unions often provide Payday Alternative Loans (PALs) — small, short-term loans with lower fees and interest rates compared to traditional payday loans.

Co-signed Loans

If you have a friend or family member with good credit who is willing to co-sign a loan, you may be able to qualify for a traditional personal loan despite bad credit.

What sets us apart.

Learn more about payday loan alternatives.
What are online payday loans?
Online payday loans are short-term, small-principal loans that you can apply for using your mobile device or computer — sometimes with no credit check. These online loans are often used to take care of unexpected expenses and are repaid upon a borrower’s next payday.

CashNetUSA offers alternatives to payday loans in the form of lines of credit and installment loans. For more information about what is available in your state, visit our Rates & Terms page.

What is the best payday loan alternative?
There are several payday loan alternatives that may be able to help you access cash without the financial risks that can come with payday loans. Keep in mind that the ""best"" loan option is the one that is best for the individual person.

Personal loans. Personal loans generally refer to installment loans, which often have lower interest rates and better terms compared to payday loans.

Credit card cash advances. If you already have a credit card, a cash advance can be a cheaper option than a payday loan. However, be cautious, as cash advances often come with high interest rates and additional fees.

Nonprofits or government assistance. Some nonprofit organizations or government programs offer emergency financial assistance or low-interest loans to help with unexpected expenses. These can be a good option if you need money for basic needs like housing, utilities or medical bills.

Borrowing from family or friends. While not ideal or possible for everyone, borrowing from family or friends can be a way to avoid interest and fees. Just be sure to set clear repayment terms to avoid straining relationships.

Where does CashNetUSA offer or arrange payday loan alternatives?
CashNetUSA currently operates in 12 states: Alabama, Delaware, Idaho, Kansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Utah and Wisconsin.

What do you need to get a payday loan alternative from CashNetUSA?
In order to be eligible to apply with CashNetUSA, you must:

Be 18 years of age or older
Receive a verifiable, steady source of income
Have an active checking account
Be a U.S. citizen or permanent resident
Depending on where you live, you may not be eligible to apply with CashNetUSA. Check out our Rates & Terms page to learn which products (if any) are available in your state.

What’s the difference between a payday loan and a personal loan?
A payday loan is a form of personal loan. However personal loans commonly refer to installment loans. The main differences between payday loans and installment loans are the repayment periods and loan amounts. Normally, payday loans are issued for smaller dollar amounts than installment loans and are repaid with your next paycheck.

Installment loans, on the other hand, can be issued for larger amounts of money than payday loans, depending on the borrower, location and lender. The loan repayment term for an installment loan is also typically longer, which can range from a few months to a few years.

Does CashNetUSA offer same-day loans?
At CashNetUSA, we strive to provide a fast and hassle-free funding process. Customers are generally funded the same day if their online application receives approval before 1:00 p.m. CT Monday - Friday. Applications approved other times are generally funded the next business day.† The exact timing of receipt of funds depends on the customer's banking institution.

"FINANCE CHARGES HOW TO COMPUTE THE FINANCE CHARGE: The unpaid principal balance for each day is multiplied by the daily periodic rate to determine the FINANCE CHARGE for that day. The sum of these daily charges is the FINANCE CHARGE I will pay. The unpaid principal balance is that balance which is in my account at the close of business after all transactions, including payments and new borrowings, have been entered. FINANCE CHARGES will be imposed from the date of disbursement.  There is no grace period. OTHER CHARGES I understand this Open-End Loan Agreement is subject to a $2.00 fee for a transfer of funds to cover an overdraft check. (Optional - charged only if I wish to receive notice.) LATE CHARGES: A late charge of $25.00 will apply to any loan payment that is received seven (7) or more days past the due date as indicated on your statement. SECURITY INTEREST SECURITY INTEREST: The Credit Union requires a security interest for all loan types. On secured advances I will pledge and grant a security interest under the provisions of the Uniform Commercial Code and under the terms of the Open-End Loan Agreement and Security Agreement in the personal property which was purchased with the advance or otherwise required to secure the advance. Collateral securing other loans with the Credit Union will also secure loans made under this agreement. Real Estate Loans are not covered by this cross collateral agreement. GENERAL PLEDGE OF SHARES AND DEPOSITS:  I pledge all paid shares and deposits and payments thereon which I now have or hereafter may have with you to the extent of all unpaid balances due you. In case of default, I hereby authorize you to apply any and all such funds to the payment of the unpaid balances. However, I retain full access to any and all shares on deposit not specifically pledged as collateral. No lien or right to impress a lien on shares and deposits shall apply to any of my shares which may be held in an “Individual Retirement Account” (IRA).

I MUST NOTIFY THE CREDIT UNION IN CASE OF ERRORS OR QUESTIONS ABOUT MY STATEMENT. If I think my statement is wrong, or if I need more information about a transaction on my statement, I will write the Credit Union on a separate sheet at the address listed on my statement. I will write to the Credit Union as soon as possible. You must hear from me no later than 60 days after you sent me the first statement on which the error or problem appeared. I can telephone you, but doing so will not preserve my rights. In my letter, I will give you the following information: ●  My name and account number; ●  The dollar amount of the suspected error; ●  Describe the error and explain, if I can, why I believe there is an error. If I need more information, I will describe the item I am not sure about. MY RIGHTS AND YOUR RESPONSIBILITIES AFTER YOU RECEIVE MY WRITTEN NOTICE: You must acknowledge my letter within 30 days, unless you have corrected the error by then. Within 90 days, you must either correct the error or explain why you believe the statement was correct. After you receive my letter, you cannot try to collect any amount I question, or report me as delinquent. You can continue to send statements to me for the amount I question including finance charges, and you can apply any unpaid amount against my credit limit. I do not have to pay any questioned amount while you are investigating, but I am still obligated to pay the parts of my statement that are not in question. If you find that you have made a mistake on my statement, I will not have to pay any finance charges related to any questioned amount. If you didn’t make a mistake, I may have to pay finance charges, and I will have to make up any missed payments on the questioned amount. In either case, you will send me a statement of the amount I owe and the date that it is due. If I fail to pay the amount that you think I owe, you may report me as delinquent. However, if your explanation does not satisfy me and I write to you within 10 days telling you that I still refuse to pay, you must tell anyone you report me to that I have a question about my statement. And, you must tell me the name of anyone you reported me to. You must tell anyone you report me to that the matter has been settled between us when it finally is. If you don’t follow these rules, you can’t collect the first $50.00 of the questioned amount, even if my statement was correct. INSTRUCTIONS The minimum monthly payment on all Instant Cash Loan Advances is 3% of the balance outstanding after each advance. The payment will not change until a subsequent advance is taken.  At no time will the payment be less than $20.00. A payment is due every month on the due date but not later than the last day of the  month. The minimum payment will be increased by any balance outstanding in excess of my credit limit. Payment amounts and due dates on all accounts other than the Instant Cash Loan will be shown on a Loan Advance Request Voucher issued at the time of each advance. If you send an amount greater than your minimum monthly payment, we will automatically advance your next payment due date by the number of whole monthly payments satisfied by the extra funds. Each payments is applied first to unpaid late fees and charges, then to the accrued interest due on the loan and the remaining amount is applied to the principal balance. Payments cannot be applied to future interest because interest accrues under the formula disclosed above under ""Finance Charges."" PENALTY RATE The ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE charged on this loan is disclosed to you on Schedule A and on any loan advance voucher. Your failure to properly secure or to cooperate with us to properly secure a first priority security interest in collateral you have pledged for an advance under this loan within twenty (20) days of such advance shall result in an ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE of 18% being charged to the total outstanding balance for that advance. The ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE  on all other advances shall not be changed. In the event you produce evidence acceptable by us that a lien has been placed providing the credit union with a first priority security interest in the collateral pledged for the advance we will reinstate the initial ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE to the rate disclosed to you on Schedule A or loan advance voucher.

Collateral securing other loans with the Credit Union will also secure loans made under this agreement. Real Estate Loans are not covered by this cross collateral agreement. GENERAL PLEDGE OF SHARES AND DEPOSITS: I pledge all paid shares and deposits and payments thereon which I now have or hereafter may have with you to the extent of all unpaid balances due you. In case of default, I hereby authorize you to apply any and all such funds to the payment of the unpaid balances. However, I retain full access to any and all shares on deposit not specifically pledged as collateral. No lien or right to impress a lien on shares and deposits shall apply to any of my shares which may be held in an “Individual Retirement Account” (IRA). PAYMENT SCHEDULE SEE “SCHEDULE A” FOR CURRENT LOAN RATES The minimum monthly payment on all Instant Cash Loan Advances is 3% of the balance outstanding after each advance. The payment will not change until a subsequent advance is taken. At no time will the payment be less than $20.00. A payment is due every month on the due date but not later than the last day of the  month. The minimum payment will be increased by any balance outstanding in excess of my credit limit. Payment amounts and due dates on all accounts other than the Instant Cash Loan will be shown on a Loan Advance Request Voucher issued at the time of each advance. If you send an amount greater than your minimum monthly payment, we will automatically advance your next payment due date by the number of whole monthly payments satisfied by the extra funds. Each payments is applied first to unpaid late fees and charges, then to the accrued interest due on the loan and the remaining amount is applied to the principal balance. Payments cannot be applied to future interest because interest accrues under the formula disclosed above under ""Finance Charges.""

-END LOAN AND SECURITY AGREEMENT IN THESE AGREEMENTS, THE WORDS “I,” “ME,” “MY” AND “MINE” WILL MEAN ALL PERSONS WHO COMPLETED A “CREDIT APPLICATION FOR ALL CREDIT”  OR ENDORSED THE LOAN PROCEEDS CHECK.  THE WORDS “YOU,” “YOUR” AND “YOURS” WILL MEAN THE CREDIT UNION. I agree to this Loan and Security Agreement and Disclosure Statement and any future amendments thereto, and promise to pay you all sums advanced under this agreement, plus a Finance Charge. LOAN AGREEMENT 1. Advances:  You will make loan advances to me.  I understand that all advances must be made for good purposes.  Advances shall be made at my request by means of check, loan draft, electronic transfer, deposit to my checking account, or other account designated by me. 2. Credit Limits:  Advances against my Instant Cash Loan Account will at no time, in total, exceed the limit as set forth to me.  Advances on secured loans will depend on the value of security offered at the time of each advance. 3. Payments:  The minimum monthly payment and due date on all Instant Cash Loan Advances is explained on the reverse side.  The minimum monthly payment and due date on all secured loan advances will be set and disclosed to me at the time each advance is made on the Loan Advance Request Voucher.  My minimum payment will not change unless I request additional advances or fail to keep my agreement.  I understand that my payments will first be applied to pay late charges or other charges, if any, finance charges, and then to my outstanding advance balances.  I may pay the credit balance in full or in part at any time without penalty.  Minimum monthly payments shall not be reduced even though the unpaid principal balance declines as payments are made.  I understand that payroll deductions are NOT a condition of this loan.  If the payroll deduction is not received in time to make a loan payment, or if the payroll deduction is insufficient to make a full payment, I understand that it is MY RESPONSIBILITY to make the loan payment each month when payment is due. 4. Computation of Finance Charge:  Finance Charges on each loan will be computed at the Daily Periodic Rate and Annual Percentage Rate shown on the then current “Schedule A” or Loan Advance Request Voucher. 5. Credit Insurance:  Credit life or credit disability insurance is not required as a condition of credit.  If I choose voluntary credit life and/or credit disability insurance, the premiums for such coverage will be added to my outstanding balance.  If I do not make any payment when due, you may at your option, cancel such coverage.  You may also have the option of paying the insurance premiums and adding them to my outstanding balance where they will be subject to the annual percentage rate disclosed. 6. Late Charges:  A late charge, as shown on the reverse side of this document, may be assessed on late payments.  In any event, interest is charged for each day a balance is outstanding.  Any payment that (A) delays or (B) accelerates the reduction of my account balance will (A) increase or (B) decrease the total interest cost on my account. 7. Default:  I will be in default if I fail to make any payment when due, fail to keep or perform any promise made to you or agreement with you, if any information I have furnished proves to have been false, if I die, become insolvent or file a bankruptcy case, or if a third party tries by legal process to take any of my property or money.  If I am in default then you may, at your option, and without notice to me, declare this account to be immediately due and payable.  I must pay to you at that time the total unpaid balance, as well as the Finance Charge to date.  I further agree to pay your costs of collection, including reasonable attorney’s fees.  The Finance Charges as described in paragraph 4 of this agreement shall be payable before and after any breach of the agreement. 8. Debtor Responsibility:  I promise to notify you of any change in my name, address, or employment.  I promise not to apply for a loan if I know there is a reasonable probability that I will be unable to repay my obligation according to the terms of the credit extension.  I promise to inform you of any new information which relates to my ability to repay my obligation.  I promise not to submit false or inaccurate information or willfully conceal information regarding my credit worthiness, credit standing or credit capacity. 9. General Pledge of Shares:  I pledge my shares and deposits in the Credit Union.  In case I default, you may apply these shares and deposits to the payment of all sums due at the time of default, including costs of collection and reasonable attorney’s fees.  No lien or right to impress a lien on shares and deposits shall apply to any of my shares which may be held in an “Individual Retirement Account” (IRA). 10. Termination:  I understand that you may terminate this Loan and Security Agreement under any of the following conditions:   (1) Upon adverse re-evaluation of my credit worthiness.  (2) If I should fail to meet the terms of this agreement.  (3) At my option, or your option, with good cause and upon written notice.  I understand that termination will not affect my obligation to pay the balance outstanding incurred prior to the notice. 11. Checking Overdraft Authorization:  (If applicable)  The checking account mentioned in this section is also governed by another agreement between you and me.  If this agreement conflicts with any of the provisions governing the checking account, the provisions of this agreement shall control.  If I have a checking account with you, I agree that whenever I (or anyone authorized to sign on my checking account) write a check which when posted to my checking account exceeds the balance in the account by one cent or more, the check shall constitute a request for an advance against my Instant Cash Loan Account in increments of $100.00 which will be sufficient to permit the Credit Union to pay such check.  Any advances so made shall be subjected to the terms of this agreement.  The amount of any advance approved by you shall be credited to my checking account as a deposit.  These provisions also apply should I overdraw my checking account by means of an Automated Teller Machine or other electronic means.  Deposits to my checking account made after a loan advance are not automatically credited back to my loan. 12. Additional Provisions: (1) I agree to provide you with a current financial statement if you so request and understand that no advance will be made until you have reviewed that financial statement. (2)  Each provision of this agreement must be considered as part of the total agreement, and cannot in any way be severed from it.  However, I also agree that should any part of this agreement be found invalid, it will in no way affect the remainder of this agreement. (3)  I acknowledge that I have received a copy of this Open-End Loan Agreement, and that I have fully read and understand all its terms and conditions. (4) My signing and endorsing any checks or drafts, issued under this agreement or my use of any money advanced under this agreement shows my acceptance of its terms and conditions. SECURITY AGREEMENT 1. I hereby grant to you a security interest according to the provisions of the Uniform Commercial Code in any property pledged as collateral under this agreement as described on my Loan Advance Request Voucher.  Unless it is household goods, as that term is defined in the Credit Practices Rule, or real estate that is my primary residence, this collateral also secures any other obligation I owe to you, regardless when such obligations are or were incurred. In addition, unless it is household goods, as that term is defined in the Credit Practices Rule, or real estate that is my primary residence, any propety       securing other loans I have with you will also secure advances made under this agreement. 2. The collateral will be kept at the address shown on my application and I will not change the location of, sell or transfer the collateral unless I have your prior written consent. 3. I promise that I own the collateral and that no one else has any interest in it or claim against it.  I agree not to sell or lease the collateral or to give it as collateral to anyone until the advance secured by the collateral has been paid. 4. I will pay all taxes, assessments, and liens against or attached to the collateral and I further agree to keep it in good condition and housed in a suitable shelter.  I agree to execute financing statements and security agreement amendments at your request and will defend the property against adverse third party claims.  I will not remove the collateral from the state of my residence as shown on my application unless I have your permission. 5. I will maintain insurance against loss by Fire, Theft, or Collision and Comprehensive Coverage on motor vehicles or other property in which you have a security interest.  This insurance may be obtained from any insurance broker of my choice.  This insurance will be in a form and an amount satisfactory to you.  I will supply you with proof of such insurance and have you named as loss payee until all sums owed to you and secured by this property are repaid.  If I fail to maintain such insurance, you may, but are not required to, obtain insurance of your own and the cost of such insurance may be added to my account.  At your option the cost of such insurance, shall be paid on demand or paid by way of increased payments over the term of the insurance policy.  This cost may bear interest at the contract rate until paid.  I further assign to you the right to receive the proceeds of any insurance on such property, and direct any insurer to pay those proceeds directly to you.  I authorize you to increase my payroll deduction to cover the cost of insurance if necessary.  I authorize you to endorse any check or draft provided as the proceeds of such insurance, and apply those proceeds to the sums owed to you.  I further authorize you to provide your insurance service center with the necessary information for verification of adequate coverage.  I acknowledge that insurance, or any extension thereof, placed by you is without benefit to me individually but is primarily for your protection. 6. You may meet all requirements for sending me a notice of any kind if you send it to me by means of United States mail, at my last given address. 7. Any additional advances made to me for the payment of taxes or assessments or liens of any kind, or premiums on authorized insurance and interest owing thereon shall also be secured by this agreement. 8. In return for the sums advanced, I grant you the authority to repossess and sell the collateral should I default in making my payments, or should I fail to discharge any liability I may have under this agreement, or should any statement I have made to you prove false.  In such case, you or your authorized representatives may enter the premises where the collateral is kept and take possession, without being liable for trespass and without legal process. 9. Unless I default, I may keep possession of the property (collateral) described and use it in any lawful manner consistent with this agreement or with the insurance policy on the collateral.  I understand that you have certain rights and legal remedies available to you under the Uniform Commercial Code and other applicable laws, and that you may use these rights to enforce payment if I default.  In that event, I will at your request, assemble the property (collateral) and make it available to you at a place of your choosing.  If you decide to waive any default, it will not constitute waiver of any other subsequent defaults. 10. You are hereby appointed as my irrevocable Attorney-in-fact, coupled with an interest, to perform any acts which you feel are necessary to protect the collateral and the security interest which this agreement creates. 11. If there is more than one borrower, our obligations under this agreement are joint and several, each being equally responsible to fulfill the terms of this agreement. 12. Should you feel at any time the security presented has diminished in value, or for any other reason feel that additional security is required, I agree to assign to you within 10 days whatever additional security you feel is necessary to protect yourself against possible loss. 13. I acknowledge that I have received a copy of the Open-End Security Agreement, that I have fully read, understand and agree to be bound by all its terms and conditions prior to my signing. 14. My signing and endorsing any checks or drafts issued under this agreement or my use of any money advanced under this agreement shows my acceptance of its terms and conditions. CHANGE OF TERMS We may change any term or condition of this Agreement at any time. Unless otherwise required by law to provide you with an advance notice of such change we will provide you with notice of the change in a manner we deem appropriate.

""Card"" means the Visa® credit card and any other access devices, duplicates, renewals, or substitutions, including convenience checks, the Credit Union issues to You. ""Account"" means the line of credit established by this Agreement and includes Your Card. SECURITY INTEREST If You give the Credit Union a specific pledge of shares by signing a separate pledge of shares, Your pledged shares will secure Your Account. You may not withdraw amounts that have been specifically pledged to secure Your Account until the Credit Union agrees to release all or part of the pledged amount. 1. USING YOUR ACCOUNT — By using the Account or keeping the Card, You agree to the terms of this Agreement. You agree to use Your Account in accordance with this Agreement. Your Account must only be used for lawful transactions. 2. CREDIT LIMIT — We may establish a credit limit as part of this Agreement, which You promise not to exceed. If You exceed the credit limit, You promise to repay immediately the amount which exceeds the credit limit, including amounts due to finance charges, fees or other charges. You may request a credit limit increase on Your Account only by a method acceptable to the Credit Union. We may increase or decrease Your credit limit, refuse to make an advance and/or terminate Your Account at any time for any reason permitted by law. 3. CONVENIENCE CHECKS — We may, from time to time, issue convenience checks to You that may be drawn on Your Account. Convenience checks may not be used to make a payment on Your Account. If You use a convenience check, it will be posted to Your Account as a cash advance. We reserve the right to refuse to pay a convenience check drawn on Your Account for any reason and such refusal shall not constitute wrongful dishonor. You may request that We stop the payment of a convenience check drawn on Your Account. You agree to pay any fee as identified in this Agreement imposed to stop a payment on a convenience check issued on Your Account. You may make a stop payment request orally, if permitted, or in writing. Your request must be made with sufficient time in advance of the presentment of the check for payment to give Us a reasonable opportunity to act on Your request. In addition, Your request must accurately describe the check including the exact Account number, the payee, any check number that may be applicable, and the exact amount of the check. If permitted, You may make a stop payment request orally but such a request will expire after 14 days unless You confirm Your request in writing within that time. Written stop payment orders are effective only for six months and may be renewed for additional six month periods by requesting in writing that the stop payment order be renewed.

4. REPAYMENT — You promise to repay all amounts You owe under this Agreement. Your promise to repay includes all transactions made to Your Account by You or anyone You authorize to use Your Account as well as all interest charges and fees. For each billing period, You must pay at least the Minimum Payment Due by the Payment Due Date. The Minimum Payment Due is 2.00% of Your total New Balance, or $20.00, whichever is greater, plus any amount past due and any amount by which You have exceeded Your applicable credit limit. If Your total New Balance is less than $20.00, then Your Minimum Payment Due is the amount of the total New Balance. You may pay more frequently, pay more than the Minimum Payment Due or pay the total New Balance in full. If You make extra or larger payments, You are still required to make at least the Minimum Payment Due each month Your Account has a balance (other than a credit balance). The Credit Union may delay replenishing Your credit limit until the date the payment is posted or the Credit Union confirms the payment has cleared. Your payment of the required Minimum Payment Due may be applied to what You owe the Credit Union in any manner the Credit Union chooses, as permitted by applicable law. If You make a payment in excess of the required Minimum Payment Due, the Credit Union will allocate the excess amount first to the balance with the highest annual percentage rate (“APR”) and any remaining portion to the other balances in descending order based on applicable APR, unless otherwise prescribed by applicable law. We may accept checks marked ""payment in full"" or with words of similar effect without losing any of Our rights to collect the full balance of Your Account with Us. 5. INTEREST AND FINANCE CHARGES — We will begin charging You interest on purchases on the date the transaction is posted to Your Account. We will begin charging You interest on cash advances and balance transfers on the date of the transaction. However, We will not charge You any interest on new purchases if Your Account had a zero or credit balance at the beginning of that billing cycle, or You paid the entire new balance on the previous cycle's billing statement by the Payment Due Date of that statement. To avoid an additional finance charge on the balance of purchases, You must pay the entire new balance on the billing statement by the Payment Due Date of that statement. If You are permitted to obtain cash advances on Your Account, purchases of instruments, and transactions that We consider the equivalent of cash will be posted to Your Account as cash advances, including, but not limited to, wire transfers, money orders, bets, lottery tickets, casino gaming chips, and cryptocurrency. How We Calculate Your Balance: Interest charges on Your Account are calculated separately for purchases, balance transfers and cash advances (“Transaction Type”). We figure the interest charge for each Transaction Type by applying the periodic rate to each corresponding “average daily balance.” To get the “average daily balance” for a Transaction Type We take the beginning balance for that Transaction Type each day, add any new transactions of that type, and subtract any unpaid interest or other finance charges and any applicable payments or credits. This gives Us the daily balance for each Transaction Type. Then, for each Transaction Type, We add up all the daily balances for the billing cycle and divide each total by the number of days in the billing cycle. This gives Us the “average daily balance” for each Transaction Type. 6. FEES — In addition to the periodic rate, additional fees may be imposed on Your Account. If applicable to Your Account, the fee amounts and explanations are disclosed on the Account Opening Disclosure accompanying this Agreement. 7. FOREIGN TRANSACTIONS — Purchases and cash advances made in foreign currencies will be debited from Your Account in U.S. dollars. The exchange rate between the transaction currency and the billing currency used for processing international transactions is a rate selected by Visa from a range of rates available in wholesale currency markets for the applicable central processing date, which rate may vary from the rate Visa itself receives or the government-mandated rate in effect for the applicable central processing date. The exchange rate used on the processing date may differ from the rate that would have been used on the purchase date or cardholder statement posting date. 8. AUTHORIZATIONS — We do not guarantee authorization of a transaction, either by Us or by a third party, even if You have sufficient credit available. You agree that We will not be liable for failing to give an authorization. We also reserve the right to limit the number of transactions that may be approved in one day. We reserve the right to deny certain transactions for any reason and at Our sole discretion, including for default, suspected fraudulent or unlawful activity, internet gambling or any indication of increased risk related to the transaction or the Account. You agree that We have no requirement to notify You of the specific reason We denied a transaction. If We detect unusual or suspicious activity, We may suspend Your credit privileges until We can verify the activity, or We may close the Account. 9. INFORMATION UPDATING SERVICE AND AUTHORIZATIONS — IfYou have authorized a merchant to bill charges to Your Card on a recurring basis, it is Your responsibility to notify the merchant in the event Your Card is replaced, Your Account information (such as Card number or expiration date) changes, or Your Account is closed. However, if Your Card is replaced or Your Account information changes, You authorize Us, without obligation on Our part, to provide the updated Account information to the merchant in order to permit the merchant to bill recurring charges to Your Card. You authorize Us to apply such recurring charges to Your Card until You notify Us that You have revoked authorization for the charges to Your Card.
Your Card is automatically enrolled in an information updating service. Through this service, Your updated Account information (such as Card number or expiration date) may be shared with participating merchants to facilitate continued recurring charges. Updates are not guaranteed before Your next payment to a merchant is due. You are responsible for making direct payment until recurring charges resume. To revoke Your authorization allowing Us to provide updated Account information to a merchant, please contact Us. 10. PREAUTHORIZED CHARGES — We may suspend preauthorized recurring charges with merchants if, for example, Your Card is lost or stolen, You default, or We change Your Account for any reason. If preauthorized recurring charges are suspended, You are responsible for making direct payment for such charges until You contact the merchant to reinstate recurring charges. 11. DEFAULT — You will be in default under this Agreement if You fail to pay the Minimum Payment Due by its Payment Due Date; pay by a check or similar instrument that is not honored or that We must return because it cannot be processed; pay by automatic debit that is returned unpaid; make any false or misleading statements in any credit application or credit update; file for bankruptcy; or die. You will also be in default if You fail to comply with the terms of this Agreement or any other Agreement You have with Us. If You default, We may close Your Account and require You to pay any unpaid balance immediately, subject to applicable law. In this Agreement and on Your Credit Card Application, You gave Us a security interest in all individual or joint share and/or deposit accounts with the Credit Union and authorized Us, if You defaulted, to apply the balance in these accounts to any amounts due. You agree We may rely on Your agreement and authorization to, upon Your default, apply any balance to any amounts due on Your Account. 12. LIABILITY FOR UNAUTHORIZED USE-LOST/STOLEN CARD NOTIFICATION — If You notice the loss or theft of Your credit card or a possible unauthorized use of Your Card, You should write to Us immediately at PO Box 67013, Harrisburg, PA, 17106 or call Us at (800) 237-7328 or (800) 556-5678, seven days a week 24 hours a day. You will not be liable for any unauthorized use that occurs after You notify Us. You may, however, be liable for unauthorized use that occurs before Your notice to Us. You will have no liability for unauthorized use unless You are found to be fraudulent or negligent in the handling of Your Account or Card. In any case, Your liability for unauthorized transactions will not exceed $50. 13. CHANGING OR TERMINATING YOUR ACCOUNT — As permitted by law, the Credit Union may change the terms of this Agreement and any attached Disclosure from time to time. Notice of any change will be given in accordance with applicable law. To the extent permitted by law, changes to the Agreement may apply to Your existing account balance as well as to future transactions. Arizona, California, Idaho, Louisiana, New Mexico, Nevada, Texas, Washington, and Wisconsin Residents- Either You, Your spouse or the Credit Union may terminate this Agreement at any time, but termination by You, Your spouse or the Credit Union will not affect Your obligation to pay the account balance plus any finance and other charges You or Your spouse owe under this Agreement.

The Card or Cards You receive remain the property of the Credit Union and You must recover and surrender to the Credit Union all Cards upon request or upon termination of this Agreement whether by You or the Credit Union.

Your notice must include the name of the authorized user and Your Account number and/or any subaccount number issued to the authorized user along with the authorized user's Card and any convenience or other access checks issued to the authorized user.

Alternatively, We may, at Our sole discretion, issue You a new Account number and a new Card. 15.

You authorize the Credit Union to disclose information regarding Your Account to credit bureaus and creditors who inquire about Your credit standing. 16. JOINT ACCOUNTS — If this is a joint Account, each of You will be individually and jointly responsible for paying all amounts owed under this Agreement.

"This Consumer Loan Agreement (“Agreement”) governs your Loan accounts with United Trades Federal Credit Union. In this Agreement the terms “you” and “your” mean each person who signs the Consumer Loan Application, an Advance Disclosure or this Agreement as a borrower or owner of collateral, as applicable. The term “Credit Union” means United Trades Federal Credit Union. P.O. Box 2293 Tualatin, OR 97062 Ph: 503.283.5193 without getting specific approval for additional Line of Credit advances. If you overdraw a deposit account of yours, you agree we may treat that transaction as a request for an advance and your authorization to transfer funds to cover such overdraft.  1. Consumer Loan Documents   Under this Agreement you are establishing an ongoing Loan relationship with the Credit Union. You may request and receive Consumer Loans from time to time and you may establish a Personal Line of Credit account.  a. Consumer Loans. Each Consumer Loan that you request, and we approve from time to time will be considered a separate Loan transaction that is consummated at the time a Loan Advance Disclosure for each Loan is accepted by you. The terms applicable to your Consumer Loans will be governed by: (i) the Consumer Loan Application; (ii) this Agreement; (iii) the Loan Advance Disclosures provided with each Loan; (iv) a Loan proceeds check endorsement; and (v) other Loan documents required under this Agreement. These Loan documents are incorporated in and integrated as part of this Agreement.  b. Line of Credit. Upon your request and approval by the Credit Union, your Line of Credit will be established as an open-end, revolving Line of Credit. The terms applicable to your Line of Credit account will be governed by: (i) the Consumer Loan Application; (ii) this Agreement; (iii) the Line of Credit Account Disclosure provided at account opening; (iv) a Loan proceeds check endorsement; and (v) other Loan documents required under this Agreement. These Loan documents are incorporated in and integrated as part of this Agreement.  2. Accessing Your Loans & Line of Credit  If more than one person signs this Agreement or one of the Loan documents, your obligations under this Agreement, are joint and several. You and any co-applicant, jointly or alone, may request and receive Loan advances under this Agreement, to suspend further advances, or terminate this Agreement. You may request Loan advances in person, by mail, by telephone or electronic transfer service, or Loan draft to the extent applicable. The Credit Union may disburse Loan proceeds to you directly, to third parties, or to a deposit or share account of yours or any co-applicant in accordance with your instructions. a. Consumer Loan Advances. You may request and obtain one or more Consumer Loans from the Credit Union from time to time. You will receive a Loan Advance Disclosure at the time of each Loan which will contain specific disclosures regarding Loan amount, interest rate, fees, and security related to the particular advance. You may decline any Loan transaction after receiving the Advance Disclosure without obligation by notifying us within three days after receiving the Advance Disclosure and returning all Loan proceeds to us. However, once you have consummated the Loan transaction by retaining or using the Loan proceeds, you may no longer decline Loan the transaction.  b. Line of Credit Advances. You may request and obtain a Line of Credit account from the Credit Union. You will receive Line of Credit Account Disclosures at the time your account is opened which will contain specific disclosures regarding interest charges, fees, and terms related to the account. At the time of your initial Line of Credit advance, you will receive Personal Line of Credit Advance Disclosures which will contain specific disclosures regarding your approved credit limit, payment terms, and security related to the account. For a Line of Credit account, you may access credit on your account up to your approved credit limit, prepay any portion of the balance, and request subsequent advances from time to time without limitation, provided you are not in default. The approved credit limit for a Line of Credit account is the maximum amount you may draw upon at any time under that account 3. Payment Terms a. Promise to Pay. You promise to pay the Credit Union all Loan or Line of Credit advances, interest, fees and charges and other amounts due in accordance with this Agreement.  b. Payment Methods. You may make payments on your Consumer Loan or Line of Credit by automatic transfer from shares, payroll deduction, or by direct payment, as applicable. If you make automatic transfer payments, you are responsible for maintaining adequate funds in your account to satisfy your payments. If the Credit Union does not receive your payroll deduction, the Credit Union will not waive your payment requirement and you remain responsible for making timely payments. You may pay all or any portion of your account at any time without penalty, but any such prepayment will not relieve you of your obligation to make the required minimum payments. After your loans are paid, the Credit Union may deposit payroll deduction amounts to your share account unless otherwise notified.  c. Periodic Payments. For Consumer Loans, you agree to make the Periodic Payment as specified on the Loan Advance Disclosure by the due date specified by the Credit Union. In addition to the Periodic Payment, you agree to pay all amounts past due, including any late fees, immediately. For Line of Credit accounts, your Periodic Payment will equal 3% of the outstanding balance after the most recent advance, or $25, whichever is greater. d. Crediting Payments. Payments received at any office of the Credit Union prior to any posted transaction cutoff hours will be credited as of the day they are received and processed. Payments received after a transaction cutoff hour may not be credited until the next business day. All payments will be credited first to fees and charges, then to accrued interest, and finally to the outstanding principal balance of your Loan or Line of Credit. 4. Interest Charges a. When Interest Accrues. Each Consumer Loan or Line of Credit advance will accrue interest beginning on the date the advance is posted to your account. Interest will continue to accrue on your account until the entire outstanding balance is paid in full. Loan advances deposited to a deposit account will be subject to interest from the date of deposit even if the funds are not withdrawn immediately. b. How to Determine Interest. You will pay interest based on the unpaid principal balance of your Loan or Line of Credit. The unpaid principal balance is the outstanding account balance which remains unpaid at the close of business each day after all transactions for the day have been posted. The interest based on your unpaid principal balance is computed by multiplying that balance by a Periodic Rate and multiplying by the number of days since the last payment or credit. To get the Periodic Rate, we divide the interest rate by 365.  c. Interest Rate. The interest rate for each Loan will be set forth on the Loan Advance Disclosure. For Line of Credit accounts, the interest rate will be set forth on the Line of Credit Advance Disclosure. The Credit Union may change the rates it offers from time to time. If your loan is 40 days late or more we may increase the interest rate to 18% for as long as you are in default or six months, whichever is longer. You may request reduction of the rate after six months of timely payments. If payments have been made on time, during the six months review period, we may adjust the interest rate to its original rate or its original variable rate terms. 5. Fees and Charges   You agree to pay the fees and costs as set forth on the Loan Advance Disclosure provided with each Loan including any application fee. You May  2010  ▪  1 © 2010 Farleigh Wada Witt. All rights reserved. United Trades Federal Credit Union  Consumer Loan Agreem
agree to pay the fees and costs as set forth on the Line of Credit Account Disclosures. a. Late Fee. If any Loan payment is more than 15 days past due, you agree to pay a late charge of 20% of the past due interest, with a minimum of $25, and a maximum of $350. b. Returned Payment Fee. If any Loan payment is returned unpaid for any reason, you agree to pay a returned payment fee of $25. c. Transfer Fee. If we make an overdraft advance and transfer funds to a deposit account of yours, you agree to pay a $5 transfer fee. d. Collection Costs and Attorney Fees. If you are in default under the terms of this Agreement, you agree to pay the Credit Union’s costs in enforcing this Agreement and collecting any amounts you owe. The Credit Union’s costs include, to the extent permitted by applicable law, reasonable attorney fees if the Credit Union hires an attorney, and legal expenses incurred whether or not a lawsuit is commenced, plus any court costs and all other reasonable sums allowed by law. Attorney fees and legal expenses include those related to bankruptcy proceedings (including efforts to modify or vacate any automatic stay), trials, appeals, and any anticipated post-judgment collection actions. You agree that all collection costs and attorney fees incurred by the Credit Union are secured in accordance with this Agreement. e. Voluntary Payment Protection. We may offer Voluntary Payment Protection to you. Voluntary Payment Protection is not necessary to obtain credit. If you purchase Voluntary Payment Protection from us, you authorize us to add the fees or insurance charges monthly to your Loan balance and charge you interest to the entire balance. The rate used to determine the fees or insurance charges may change in the future. If the rate changes, we will provide any notices required by applicable law. 6. Events of Default You will be in default if any of the following happen: a.  b.  You fail to make any payment when due; You break any promise you have made to the Credit Union in this or any agreement with the Credit Union; c. Any other creditor or governmental agency tries to take any of the collateral, including a garnishment of your Credit Union shares; d. The collateral is abandoned, lost, stolen, damaged, sold, borrowed against, levied upon, seized, or attached; e. There is any material adverse change in your financial condition; f. You or any guarantor die, become insolvent, make an assignment for the benefit of creditors, a receiver is appointed, or a petition for bankruptcy is commenced by or against you; g. Any information or representation you make on any application or agreement with the Credit Union is not true; or h. The Credit Union in good faith deems itself insecure. 7. Credit Union Actions   You agree the Credit Union may accept late payments and partial payments and can delay enforcing any of its rights under this Agreement without losing them. The Credit Union’s waiver of its rights in one instance does not constitute a waiver of its rights in other instances, or waiver of any other default. You agree the Credit Union may permit a modification, extension, or renewal of any term under this Agreement, or release or substitute collateral or any other person obligated for repayment of this Agreement or any guaranty, and you will remain liable for repayment of your Loan or Line of Credit. The Credit Union may exercise any of its rights under the security agreement and applicable law. In addition, the Credit Union may take other actions as follows: a. Suspension of Line of Credit Advances. The Credit Union may suspend your ability to draw upon a Line of Credit or use any access device or advance checks, without prior notice to you, under the following conditions:  (i) you are in default under this Agreement or any other agreement with the Credit Union; (ii) any credit verification indicates adverse information; (iii) any time the Credit Union reasonably determines the value of the collateral has declined; or (iv) you request a suspension of this account.  b. Acceleration of Loan Balance. Upon default, you waive demand and any notice, including notice of intent to accelerate and notice of acceleration. The Credit Union may declare the entire balance of your loans immediately due, without prior notice.  c. Credit Union Lien/Security Interest. To the extent permitted by applicable law and to the extent of your indebtedness to the Credit Union, the Credit Union has a statutory lien on all your shares, deposits, and accumulated dividends or interest in all of your accounts at the Credit Union. In addition, you grant the Credit Union a security interest in all shares, deposits, and accumulated dividends or interest in all your accounts at the Credit Union, individual or joint, (except Individual Retirement Accounts). In the event that you fail to make any payments due to the Credit Union pursuant to the terms of this or any other agreement with the Credit Union, you authorize the Credit Union to immediately exercise its lien and apply the balance in these accounts to pay any indebtedness to the Credit Union, without further notice to you. d. Credit Verification. You agree to provide the Credit Union upon request at any time with current financial information, updated employment and credit information, or a new appraisal or valuation of collateral, as permitted by law. You understand that the Credit Union may record such information in its files and rely on it to make decisions about your account. You authorize the Credit Union at any time to release information to any credit bureau, merchant or other financial institution regarding the status and history of your account. 8. Security Agreement a. Security Interest. You grant the Credit Union a security interest, under the Uniform Commercial Code of the state in which the Credit Union is located, in all collateral described on any Loan Advance Disclosure or Line of Credit Account Disclosure received under this Agreement to secure your loans and Line of Credit account under this Agreement and all your other obligations (except those secured by a dwelling or real property) to the Credit Union. Collateral granted under this Agreement covers your past liabilities to the Credit Union and any liabilities that may arise in the future, regardless of form. These include, but are not limited to, loans for consumer purposes, liability which is sole or joint, absolute or contingent, primary or secondary, purchase money or non-purchase money, and liability under promissory notes, credit cards, open accounts, or overdrafts (but not loans secured by a dwelling or real property). The collateral includes accessions and additions installed in or affixed to the collateral and any proceeds of the collateral. All collateral securing this Loan will secure any extension, renewal, or modification of this Loan and all your other obligations. b. Maintenance. You agree that collateral securing this Loan will be for personal use and will not be used as a dwelling. Except for our security interest, you own the collateral free and clear. You will not allow any other liens on the collateral, even if they are junior to ours. You agree to maintain the collateral in good working order and repair any damage that affects its value. Except for vehicles, you agree to keep the collateral at your address of record, unless we tell you that you can move it. If the collateral is a vehicle, you will keep it at your present address, except for routine use, and you will not do anything that requires registering the vehicle in another state. You may move the collateral to your new address only if you give the Credit Union the new address in advance. You agree the Credit Union may come upon your premises and inspect the collateral at any reasonable time without notice. c. Insurance. You agree to keep the collateral insured with casualty and fire coverage satisfactory to the Credit Union, including an acceptable deductible. For vehicles, this means collision insurance and comprehensive insurance with a deductible amount acceptable to the 
Credit Union. You may provide this insurance through an existing policy or a new policy obtained from anyone you want that is acceptable to the Credit Union, and you agree to provide the Credit Union with proof of that coverage. You agree to name the Credit Union as loss payee. If you fail to pay any liens, buy or maintain insurance, or make repairs to the collateral, we may do so. You agree we may add any insurance or maintenance costs to the amount you owe under this Agreement and may adjust your monthly payments to pay the Loan over its originally scheduled term. The added amounts will bear interest at the rate charged under this Agreement. Insurance we purchase will cover only the Credit Union’s interest in the collateral and will not be liability insurance. This security provision also secures those amounts. You understand that all benefits paid by insurance that you or the Credit Union purchases, and any insurance refunds or rebates will be applied first to pay the Loan balance. WARNING - UNLESS YOU PROVIDE US WITH EVIDENCE OF THE INSURANCE COVERAGE AS REQUIRED BY OUR LOAN AGREEMENT, WE MAY PURCHASE INSURANCE AT YOUR EXPENSE TO PROTECT OUR INTEREST. THIS INSURANCE MAY, BUT NEED NOT, ALSO PROTECT YOUR INTEREST. IF THE COLLATERAL BECOMES DAMAGED, THE COVERAGE WE PURCHASE MAY NOT PAY ANY CLAIM YOU MAKE OR ANY CLAIM MADE AGAINST YOU. YOU MAY LATER CANCEL THIS COVERAGE BY PROVIDING EVIDENCE THAT YOU HAVE OBTAINED PROPER COVERAGE ELSEWHERE. YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE COST OF ANY INSURANCE PURCHASED BY US. THE COST OF THIS INSURANCE MAY BE ADDED TO YOUR LOAN BALANCE. IF THE COST IS ADDED TO THE LOAN BALANCE, THE INTEREST RATE ON THE UNDERLYING LOAN WILL APPLY TO THIS ADDED AMOUNT. THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF COVERAGE MAY BE THE DATE YOUR PRIOR COVERAGE LAPSED OR THE DATE YOU FAILED TO PROVIDE PROOF OF COVERAGE. THE COVERAGE WE PURCHASE MAY BE CONSIDERABLY MORE EXPENSIVE THAN INSURANCE YOU CAN OBTAIN ON YOUR OWN AND MAY NOT SATISFY ANY NEED FOR PROPERTY DAMAGE COVERAGE OR ANY APPLICABLE MANDATORY LIABILITY INSURANCE REQUIREMENTS. d. Sale of Collateral Upon Default. You may keep and use the collateral while this Agreement is not in default. If you are in default, we will have all of the rights of a secured party under the Uniform Commercial Code of the state in which the Credit Union is located, in addition to any other rights we may have. Upon request, you agree to make the collateral available to us at a place we designate. You authorize us to take possession of the collateral peaceably, with or without legal process, and sell it. If you are entitled to any notice required by applicable law, you agree that ten calendar days prior notice is enough. Unless you ask us in writing to give you notice at a different address, notice sent to you at your address of record will be sufficient. e. Additional Documents and Power of Attorney. You agree to sign any other documents, such as financing statements, applications for certificates of title, and certificates of title, to perfect our security interest. You agree to give us an irrevocable power of attorney to sign your name to title certificate(s) and to apply in your name for the issuance of a certificate or title to any motor vehicle you have given as collateral. To the extent permitted by applicable law, you agree we may endorse any check payable to you, if you refuse, and you waive protest of such action. 9.  Amendments.  To the extent permitted by applicable law, you agree the Credit Union may amend the terms of this Agreement from time to time. The Credit Union will notify you of any changes as required by law. Any notice of change in terms required by law will be sent to your address of record. You agree to inform the Credit Union in writing of your current address at all times. The Credit Union will consider this address your address of record. Notices will be mailed to you at the most recent address you have provided the Credit Union in writing. To the extent permitted by law, you agree that notice to any one borrower will be considered as giving notice to all borrowers. No oral statement by any Credit Union officer or employee is included in this Agreement, which may be modified only in writing. For Line of Credit Accounts, changes will apply to existing accounts to the extent set forth in the change in terms notice. For loans, changes will apply to new loans taken after the change becomes effective.  10. Applicable Law  You agree this Agreement will be governed by and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the State of Oregon. If any provision of this Agreement is invalid, the rest of the provisions shall remain valid. If a lawsuit is commenced, you agree to submit to jurisdiction of the courts in the county where you reside. Member Date Co-Borrower Date Grantor Date Grantor Date

"Yesterday I received dozens of texts, emails, and phone calls from multiple payday lenders saying my application has been accepted. Obviously someone got a hold of my information, but I’m not sure to what extent. The emails have my name and my email address, but I don’t know what other information may have been used. I’ve already locked my credit and set up fraud alerts on the three main credit bureaus but I’m unsure what else I need to do right now other than monitor my credit. I’m hesitant to reach out directly to any of these payday lenders, just in case there’s something a bit more nefarious happening here.

I'm 18 years old and I have been trying to find a loan, but I am not getting approved even with my mom as a cosigner. I don't want to burden my parents with this, so that's why I came out here for help. Do I go for payday loans?

"Hi, I know this is already painting me as a stupid person but I really need help. I have multiple payday loans totaling to over $600 a paycheck. It would cost me $2500 to pay these loans outright, which I don't have. I am also in a bit of credit card debt, totaling also around $2500. I am 21, and recently moved to Seattle alone which is why I took out the payday loans. I only make $2200 a month and I pay $600 a month in rent, which is not bad. I'll be honest, I suck with money but I need to figure out a way to get out of this debt. My credit score is awful, about a 570 and I feel like I am drowning.

"Hi everyone,

I'm reaching out because I'm feeling completely overwhelmed with my debt situation and I really don't know what to do. I’ve accumulated a significant amount of payday loan debt and cash advances, and right now, I feel like I'm in a black hole.

I enrolled in a debt consolidation program, but I'm facing some serious challenges. I can't even make my first payment because I’m late on my auto loan, and I think I need to prioritize that first. The debt consolidation company has warned me that if I miss even one payment, they might close my account, and if my debt goes to collections, they may not be able to help me anymore.

My credit is already in terrible shape, and I'm feeling hopeless. I just switched my direct deposit to a different bank to try to protect my paycheck, but I'm really confused about who I should pay first. 

I’m looking for any advice or personal experiences that could help me navigate this situation. Should I prioritize my auto loan, or is there a better approach? 

Thank you for any help you can offer. I really appreciate it",predatory
"Hello! I got an email detailing collections on an account from 2018 through a tribal lender; the loan originated in Idaho.

This is the first time I’ve ever been contacted over this, and from what I understand it’s past the statue of limitations of a written contract in Idaho to be sued, so I’m not really worried about that.

The email details the original date of the loan in 2018, but the collection has just appeared on my credit report stating the account was opened September of 2024, and lists the original creditor as the collection agency, which isn’t true.

What course of action can I take to at very least have my credit report show the correct date of August 2018 so that it would fall off my report next year via the 7 year rule?",predatory
"Hello !
Hope you guys can provide me with some ideas.  Ill start by saying that I completely understand what I did and how stupid it was.

About 7-8 years ago I  took out two payday loans.
1. The first one was a title loan against a beater I had.
2. I took out 1000 payday loan the same year.

This was during a very bad time while in college.  I am now in better financial position but these two are always in the back of my mind.  The car is still sitting in the driveway, waiting for someone to  claim it does not run anymore.

I have not heard from these places for over 5 years now.  Nor are these items in my credit report.  Anyone had a similar situation before? Could they hit me with a garnishment suddendly after all these years?",predatory
"I rarely write checks, so when I looked at online banking this evening and saw a check for almost $200 deducted from my account, I was suspicious. The check number seemed random and not like any checks I have ever had. I was able to see a picture of the check which actually appeared to be an electronically generated fill-in-the-blank form and not an actual physical check.

The check was paid to a payday loan company I have never heard of (had to Google the name). In the signature area it had my name typed in italics along with the message ""Authorized by your customer, no original signature required, customer authenticated."" On the bottom, the MICR line shows my bank's routing number and my account number. The back of the check was blank.

This check has actually cleared and hard-posted to my account. It is obviously not a real check that I issued and signed. How should I go about reversing this transaction? Should I call my bank or the payday loan company that ""received"" and negotiated the check?

EDIT: How is this even possible? Why would a bank accept an unsigned check? Are they possibly complicit in this?",predatory
"How bad is it to pay off a loan early? I was a cash customer on a \~$25k purchase and the best price for a cash deal vs taking their financing was a $2000 difference. Both the salesman and the finance manager were upfront with me about being able to provide a better deal if we took their financing and asked that we made at least 9 months of payments. Sales guy was a little shady and presented us an out the door figure to me that included a non existent trade and when we sat down to finalize the deal there was an ""oops we had a trade credit so now your OTD is $x"". We stood up and started to walk out and ultimately they gave us the OTD price without the trade but the whole interaction left me with a bad taste in my mouth. The finance guy seemed to be a straight shooter he didn't waste much time trying to upsell me on stuff that I had no interest in.  
  
The interest over 9 months is only a couple hundred dollars. I wasn't to keen on taking the loan and would like to just pay it off.  If I do whose payday am I wrecking and how bad?  
  
If this is relevant this was for an RV and the financing was for a ridiculous 180 months.",predatory

"My parents (60s) are substantially in debt (Roughly $250K) with no retirement savings.

Their income is about $170K a year with the majority ($120K) coming from my father. He had a heart attack last year, but is back to work. I am concerned that he is working himself to death over this debt. They have had substantial debt my whole life, with their last bankruptcy being in 2015.

They have two kids, myself (24, M) and sister (23, F). My sister, grandmother, and I all live under their roof. I graduated college last year. My sister dropped out of college due to health issues. They recently asked me to help out with a budget.

We went through the debt and it is roughly $250K with the majority being payday loans/credit cards/personal loans. We have two vehicles that are paid off, but both are costing more in repairs than they are worth. Minimum monthly payments on the debt, along with essentials (rent, utilities, insurance, tolls, internet, phone plan, food, gas, etc.) is approximately $12,500.00. I tried to make a budget, but it did not make any sense with their expenses exceeding income.

Their debt is compounding as they are taking out more debt to pay off previous debt.

From my perspective, they are probably going to need to declare bankruptcy again, but advised they see a professional. I am thinking that I should keep it there.

Do you all have any advice? Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thank you,

\*\*For Context - I am making $70K/year, have $20K in federal student loans, $30K as an emergency fund, and $10K in my 401K. No other debt. I contribute roughly $1K/month to household expenses. My grandmother has substantial debt of her own and is on social security. She contributes to household expenses in emergencies. My sister is not able to work currently, so my parents are supporting her financially. We are renting a 4 bedroom, 2 bath house with my grandmother staying in an office that we use as her bedroom.",predatory
"We have 6 payday loans and are drowning. I plan on submitting the letter to revoke ACH withdrawal today on them. I do want to repay them but can’t repay them weekly. What interest rate should I figure for them in KY? 

For example: Loan A was taken out in Feb. 2024 in the amount of 1300.00. Weekly payments have been made and 2496.79 has been paid already to them already. 

If they take me to court what interest rate will the judge use? I fully intend to repay what was borrowed but can’t continue with the every week payments now we lost an income for 5 months. ",predatory
"I work at a hospital and it's 3 days a week (12-hour shifts) mixed around so it's never the same days of the week leaving me 4 days off. I know I need a part-time to make ends meet. At this moment my paycheck is being garnished 25% and I have a consolidating firm taking money out of my bank account as well. I'm broke and I'm stuck with nothing. I have a car payment, car insurance, medical bills, and other payday loans that I took out to finish paying for school.

I have a biology bachelor's degree and don't know what to do with it. I have tried going to physician assistant (PA) school, but after three years of trying, I gave it up. Then I tried physical therapy school, but it's the same as PA school—very competitive. So I'm stuck. I have all these bills and I'm stuck at the same job doing the same thing. I don't want to work in the hospital anymore. But what can I do? I owe so much money because I took out a lot of credit cards to pay for school.

I'm trying to go back to school to do something with my bachelor's degree. I thought about teaching biology. Right now, I have to move out of my apartment because I can no longer afford the rent.

"I work as a mail carrier and last year I made 66K last year but I was still living paycheck to paycheck off of like, 1500-2000 per paycheck. I am paid Bi-weekly and have minimal bills. I recently got made fully career so more money is being taken out of my gross now (TSP 10%/ROTH 5%/healthcare) plus I have a car and personal loan along with a service called Purchasing power (basically a pay in 12 months instead of all upfront for fed workers) being allotted out of the gross before I get it. With all that I am now getting around 900-1200 per paycheck. and I always seem to have 100 left on payday.

I have a couple bills that I still live with my parents as I would have to sell my pets if I want to leave but they have me paying 500 for it all. I spend around 100 a month on food for said pets. I use brightmoneys round up feature so I can get some savings.

I do pay for a coffee every morning and sometimes eat food from a gas station or a store on my route but food wise I am normally getting the lunch deals that are like 15 dollars. I dont eat out everyday. I do have subscriptions like spotify duo for me and my girlfriend, a gym that I do go to and discords nitro. I am trying to avoid using credit cards and do not rely on them for purchases.

What am I doing wrong? Is the economy just fucked and 60K just isnt what it used to be?

"Hi there! 

I'm a newb to this community, so please forgive me if I am asking redundant questions. However, I think everyone's situation is a bit different. 

Here's my family's scenario:

- family of 4 (me, my husband, and his 2 kiddos - a 16 year old girl and 18 year old boy that is on the autism spectrum).

- I have numerous chronic health conditions that prevent me from working outside the home because each day and level of pain is different. I have filed for SSI disability in April 2023 and now I'm the queue to be processed, but my state has an average wait time of 18-24 months, routine denials and appeals, and an 86-90% denial rate. Nearly every case has to be brought before a judge for a decision - and that can take up to 3-5 years, depending on workload.

To keep my mind occupied, I went back to school to earn my bachelor's of fine arts in graphic design online. Vocational Rehabilitation covers the costs of books, tuition, supplies, materials, tuition, internet, and fuel mileage to/from all medical appointments, as well as my health insurance premium each month. While there is a LOT of paperwork and red tape to deal with using VR, I cannot complain because they have provided me EVERYTHING I need to be successful - even new MacBook pros, iPad Pro, cloud storage, software.... The list goes on. 

- My husband works as a automotive technician in a new car dealership about 35 minutes each way from home. He has been in the industry for over 25 years. His current employer and direct manager seem to be decent to work with and he likes this job so much better than the last.

HOWEVER, when he started at this current job one year ago this past February, he hired on at $25/hour with the lromoiof a review in 90 days and the possibility of raise if he produced quality, profitable work with little to no customer comebacks (customer complaints). My husband has excelled at this job because he is the most experienced in this shop of 25-30 lifts, besides the senior mainline master  mechanic. He received his raise of $1/he by June 1, 2023, placing him at $26/hr. 

But, about two months ago, his manager approached him about possibly becoming the shop foreman - watching over the other mechanics, assisting them with tasks they are not fluent or efficient with, and generally coaching the team towards better and fast completion rates, upsells, and general increase in their skill set/knowledge. 

One would think that this was an opportunity to move up - it is a supervisory position that comes with added responsibility, extra accountability, becoming lead trainer for new employees, and less time of my husband working on his own lift - and that it would come with a raise. Bot no. I'm baffled at the arrangement because he went from $26/hr to $15/he and then he makes 50¢ off of every hour the other mechanics he supervises, bills out. For example, just for my husband being at the shop from 8-5, he will make $120/day base pay. If the 4 techs under him can bill 8 hr/day each, that is a total of 32 hours x 50¢ - or $16/day in commission. That's roughly at $680/week gross paycheck. By the time taxes, insurance, retirement, etc are deducted, he might come home with a $500/week paycheck. 

Before this change in position, as a regular automotive tech, he could easily flag 38-45 hrs/week at $26hr = $1092 gross/week (based on 42 hours/week) - an average of nearly $700-725/week net.

That is a loss of about $800 per month (about $200 per week).

I should also mention that if he and his team can meet monthly quotas for upsells and accuracy percentages, he is eligible for a $500/month bonus (averages out to $125/week). Even with the monthly bonus he is still making less now than he was, though he will not listen to me. He's such a pushover when it comes to working and helping others - easily taken advantage of, maybe because when he's the martyr, he's getting that attention, praise, and ""atta boy"" that he secretly ut desperately craves. 

Otherwise, logically and mathematically, I can't make sense of the numbers. 

My husband the sole income earned for our household. Since my stepson turned 18 and is considered a legal adult (although realistically, he's 12 years old mentally and emotionally), the SSA cut his monthly disability benefits. We are currently awaiting a new case manager to assist in helping him regain those benefits and add any other possible benefits for him. 

Needless to say, our expenses each month surpass the monthly income, leaving us to bridge the gap with credit cards, and at times (against my will or consent) payday loans. I hate payday loans because the APR is 299.00% compounding. Each week, the payday loan company automatically takes half of my husband's paycheck to make that payment. 

We live in a 714 sq ft, 3 br/1 ba early 1900s bungalow with a basement. Since we rent the house, we are responsible for all utilities, trash, and yard maintenance. 

Here's our monthly breakdown;

Water/electric: ~$200.00

Natural Gas: ~60.00

Rent: $350.00 (our portion as my parents help us with the remaining $400 each month)

Groceries: ~$150.00/week

Fuel for my husband (commutes about 400 miles/week): $400.00

Fuel for my vehicle (mostly reimbursed by VR): $250.00

Streaming services (we do not have cable or satellite TV) ~$75.00

Monthly vehicle maintenance: ~$25/mo unless an emergency repair pops up

Vehicle insurance: ~$170.00

Household insurance (renter's insurance) ~$30.00

CCLI insurance for my husband and me: ~$30.00

Vehicle extended warranty/service plan (husband's vehicle): $150.00

2 vehicle loan payments: $1,276.00

Internet service (reimbursed by VR): $89.99

Health insurance premium (me only): ~$70.00 (reimbursed by VR)

Credit card payments: ~$1,050.00 (~$40,000 credit card debt + accruing interest averaging 25%)

Payday Loan: ~350.00 (+200.00% APR - original loan amount was $1,350.00 - current balance with interest as of today - $1,754.13, even after $675.00 in payments so far)

Monthly subscriptions used for school (cloud storage, reference sites, stock art, etc.):  ~$80.00 (reimbursed by VR)

Medical bill payments: ~30.00

Trash service: $60.50 every 3 months (~$20.17/mo)

Cell phone service: ~$200.00 for 2 lines and phones 

Husband insists on eating out every day at lunch during the week: $400.00

Entertainment/Dining Out together: ~$250.00

Pet care/supplies/food: $175 every 6 weeks

--------
Total monthly outflow: ~$6,000-7,000

Husband's income: ~$2,400.00
Monthly Bonus (if earned): $500.00
Monthly VR reimbursement: ~$740.00
Pet sitting side hustle (not reliable or steady) - Average of ~$60/mo +/-

TOTAL INCOME: ~$3,860.00

Overbudget: ~ $2140.00-3140.00

This is a crisis. 

I know the credit card debit, vehicle payments, payday loan and the cut in my husband's salary, and my physical inability to work because of my health are the pain points. However I am overwhelmed and at a loss as to how to even make and balance a budget with this much disparagement. 

I've thought about making an appointment with either financial planner or debt counselor to see if they can help me work out a plan. My state offers a free service for debt counseling. I met with them once and their only solution was bankruptcy, which I couldn't even afford to pay for. 

We are in our mid-to-lats 40s and really do not want to do bankruptcy as we have a dream to build a home on part of my parent's acreage in the country. Currently, our credit scores are around the 615-625 mark and we are utilizing 51-56% of our credit (keeping the credit score low due to the debt ratio).

I know this is a long shot, but does anyone have any legitimate suggestions or resources to make a plan and then this situation around? I am sick of the daily stress. DCF claims that we make too much each month - the calculate off of the gross income, although no one lives off their gross income - so we are not eligible for SNAP or LIHEAP (utility assistance program) assistance.

My husband refuses to discuss our finances - I think mostly because he knows we're in so deep and it feels like the weight of it is all on his shoulders, that he's not doing s good enough job, etc. He does like to bury and avoid issues. So frustrating. 

Any logistical help would be appreciated - resources, software for planning, etc 

Thank you. :)",predatory

"I'm 24 with $10k in credit card debt across three cards and then two payday loans at $1300 each. I pay $250/month in credit card minimums and $700/month for the loans (and the balances aren't getting any smaller.) I make $17/hr making $522/week and I pay $975/month for rent and $100/month for internet. All other bills are covered by my partner, but I get my own gas which is about $240/month. 

Already we're at $2165/month in expenses while only making $2088/month. I don't have any savings. Sometimes I doordash, but it's often not available in my area when I'm not working, or my partner wants to spend time with me after work and kinda doesn't let me go out and doordash and they're always saying there are drunk drivers and crazies on the road when DD is available in my area. I've already also sold everything of any value to my name to pay off this debt and only made a $600 dent which got filled back in by interest. 

I just want to get my crap together and get this paid off, but it feels impossible. I don't have a degree, my last job fired me in the middle of my apprenticeship because the place was having money problems, and anything I do to try to make money just ends up costing me way more. And I don't have any support from my partner because they're right, it was my own actions that got me into this spot and they don't make much more than I do. 

I've been told to just ignore all my CC minimums while I get the lower balances paid off first, but I'm worried that it could ruin my dad's credit too since he cosigned on my first credit card that has the highest debt. 
And I haven't even touched my medical debt. I'm scared to know how much is there.

I just don't know what to do and I feel lost and overwhelmed with everything. Rent is due today and I'm $50 short and I just don't know what I'm going to do and my partner is going to be incredibly disappointed in me. 

Thanks. ",predatory
"Looking for some advice on who to contact. Financial coach, financial planner (that’s all I can think of right now)?

SHORT Version:

I need a person to look over my very detailed budget and see if my spending/savings is justified. Am I saving too much or am I truly living paycheck to paycheck?

EDIT: Determined I'm not living paycheck to paycheck, but my anxiety has me feel like living that way. 

LONG version:

**I don’t (think) I have a spending issue, in reality I feel I have a to much savings issue (cheap ass).** Combined income into 6 figures with 4 kids, all which have 529 (while not large, they have money contributing into them), Maxed out work 401k, IRA that I sometimes contribute to (when market goes down), wife has 401 she is putting into, HSA that we max out,  Emergency fund of 10 months, savings fund, vacation fund, small cash fund, Mortgage payment that paying down early (2 payments extra a year), 1 vehicle loan with 1 yr left and 0% interest on a mower for 2 more yrs, no credit card debt.

I feel like all I do is save and feel like I have no money to splurge. Our checks go into our checking and then gets automatically divided into those savings accounts. At the end of the day, we have just the right amount to pay all the bills and the process starts over on payday. If there is extra at the end of the week, I will move it to savings. I am not afraid to use the savings, but try my hardest not to touch it. I bought a new gaming laptop for $900, but very quickly replenished savings

When the 6 of us go out to eat and spend $75 I feel sick for spending that much (even though that is on the cheap side of it). When the kids need new shoes, I feel sick spending more than $50. We all get haircuts at great clips at the same time, that is $75 which hurts when I pay that.  I would like to buy new shoes, but don’t want to spend $75 for new ones even thought 1.5 yrs ago I bought new $150 running shoes.  I hate paying full price for anything and will skimp on everything if given the option. My wife love to thrift shop for clothes (more “fancier” places than goodwill but still second hand). Will buy expensive gifts on Marketplace given the chance. Example, my son wanted to learn piano so for a birthday present we picked up a used (not a kiddy one) Yamaha Keyboard and lessons. We set it up with a bow and said happy birthday (along with other gifts he opened). Had we bought a new keyboard, he would have gotten the enjoyment of opening a large gift and the joy of setting it up (saved us $300).

Instead of doing a crazy vacation (cruise, all inclusive, Disney), my wife wants to go to Mt Rushmore. We have driven to FL (1000 miles one way) to save money instead of flying the 6 of use and getting a rental car down there (saved us $4000). For our trip to Mt. Rushmore coming up, we need to rent a vehicle because we are flying into DEN (to see family for a few days) and then driving. We are using Turo instead of renting from a rental service (saves us $1500). Flight is all paid for from points.

Any projects that need done, I do them all. Install a pool, build a deck, install new hvac, build a barn, install subpanel, etc. I did pay for someone to replace my garage spring (not trying to tackle that).

I have every expense calculated, from gas, groceries, fast food/eat out, animal expense, kids instrument lesson/rentals, etc…

**Or am I one of those people that are living paycheck to paycheck with 6 figure income, but also putting into savings. I feel like I couldn’t afford another big expense if I wanted!**",predatory
"I’ve been in a bloody cycle for about 4 years with payday apps. Dave, Empower, Brigit, you name it. It was so stressful! My credit score was mid 500s (I know) and through diligently being a no-life* and bunkering down at home for a few months, my credit score reached 600 even. I’ve gotten approved for a secured credit card and put aside $500 from my paycheck to deposit into it. 

It was a rough pay period where I effectively had no money while the card was being processed, but now that my payday apps are paid off and now having a credit card that actually reports, things are looking up :) I’ve been hustling at work and school, and finally made a deposit into my savings after it being DRY for years. 

Hopefully I can continue on this upward trend— only using my credit card for essential things whilst putting something in my savings. I’m very happy but very nervous. Nervous because I feel like I’m still very far from being as financially stable or independent as I’d like to be. I’m hoping to save up for a down payment on a vehicle by next month as I haven’t had a car for a few months**

*I’d still go out with friends and such! Whereas I used to go out a few times a week, I’ve only been going out once a week or once every other week. It was a real adjustment, actually. Got kinda depressed not seeing people as often as I’d used to. The extra time spent at home, I’ve dedicated to bettering myself. Been reading a lot more, studying for my classes and just chillin. It can lowkey be boring sometimes ngl but I know itll be worth it. 

**This is what makes me REALLY nervous tbh. My family is willing to help with the down payment, thankfully. Any advice on car finances? Insurance, loans, etc?

I hope at least my story can inspire some of you :)",predatory

I.CREDIT AND SECURITY AGREEMENT
A.PERSONAL LINE OF CREDIT AND CREDIT CARD
This Credit and Security Agreement (“Agreement”), which includes Truth in Lending Act and Fair Credit Billing
Disclosures, governs your consumer loan plan (“Plan”) with Boeing Employees’ Credit Union (“BECU”). Your Plan
involves open-end personal line of credit and credit card extensions of credit for personal, family, or household
purposes. In this Agreement the words “you,” and “your” mean any person who signs in acceptance of the Plan
and the words “we,” “us,” and “our” mean BECU. When you sign as a loan applicant, you agree, jointly and
severally with any other person who signs as a loan applicant (thus establishing a “Joint Plan”), to be bound by
all the terms and conditions set out in this Credit and Security Agreement, as amended from time to time, in any
credit voucher and in any disclosures or statements of terms and conditions accompanying any access devices
given with any future credit advances, which shall collectively govern your Plan and are incorporated herein by
reference. While you may not have requested or been approved for a particular advance or device under your
Plan, you agree that if at any time in the future you request or are approved for any such credit advance or device,
your relationship with BECU for that account will be governed by these agreements.
1.How the Plan Works. The Plan is an open-end credit plan, including either or both a personal line of credit
or credit card. We contemplate that, from time to time, you will use your Plan to borrow money from us (“credit
advance”). To borrow under the Plan you must activate each of the Plan’s credit accounts individually. You may
do this by submitting a credit request as explained below. If your request is approved, we will furnish you with a
credit voucher providing information about your credit limit, annual percentage rate, any other applicable fees or
charges, and any additional terms and conditions. In this Agreement, the capitalized word “Credit Voucher” means
the document titled “Credit Voucher and Opening Disclosures” for a personal line of credit loan (“Line of Credit”)
or “BECU Visa Credit Voucher and Opening Disclosures” for a Visa® credit card (“Card”).
2.Plan Accounts. The BECU Consumer Lending Rates and Related Disclosures (the “Disclosures”) include
important information about the credit extensions and advances we offer (called “accounts” or “loans”) and
includes the range of rates that may be imposed under the Plan. Certain account transactions under the Plan,
such as line of credit advances or credit card transactions, are also subject to additional terms described later in
this Agreement that may vary from the general Plan terms set out below.
In this Agreement, the capitalized word “Loans” means extensions of credit under your Line of Credit
and/or Card.
3.Account Establishment and Access. You may submit a credit request in any manner authorized by us.
When you sign as a loan applicant on BECU’s Master Credit Application, BECU will establish a Plan under which
you may, at your option, request to establish personal line of credit and/or credit card accounts. When you have
multiple active Plans (for example, a Joint Plan with one co-applicant and another Joint Plan with a different
co-applicant) and you make a credit request, it is your responsibility to inform us under which of these Plans to
establish your account. From the date of the Plan application, we may require that you update the information
you submitted to us when you established your Plan in order for us to evaluate your credit request. If you already
have a Line of Credit and you request and qualify for a Credit Card, or if you already have a Credit Card and you
request and qualify for a Line of Credit, we will establish a new account under your Plan. We are not required
to establish an account under the Plan when you submit a credit request, and we may also refuse an advance
request at any time.
4.Joint Plans. Each time you submit a credit application for another personal line of credit and/or credit card with
a different co-applicant, you request that another Joint Plan be established for you. You understand and agree
that while a Joint Plan is in effect, you and the co-applicant of the Joint Plan: (a) has each authorized the other to
individually request, authorize, or receive credit advances; (b) has each agreed to be jointly and severally liable
for repayment of all amounts owed and for any loans obtained; and (c) has each agreed to all of the loan terms
and conditions, even if you did not specifically authorize or request the credit advance or receive any benefit from
it. If any one of you does not wish any future loans under the Plan or is unwilling to be personally liable for them,
any one of you must write to BECU to terminate the Plan and the termination will be effective as to all of you.
5.Summary of Joint Plan Consequences.
After credit approval, each of your joint applicants shall have the right to use any account under a Joint Plan to
the full extent of any credit limit set by BECU for the Joint Plan, and you will be liable for all amounts of credit
3
extended under this account to all of your joint applicants.
6. Credit Limit. If we establish a Line of Credit and/or Card account in response to your credit request, we also
will establish a credit limit on this account and may establish a separate credit limit on cash advances from this
account. You agree not to attempt to obtain more credit than the amount of the applicable credit limit. If you
temporarily exceed your credit limit, you understand such credit does not increase your credit limit and you agree
to pay us that excess amount and applicable finance charges, immediately. We can increase or decrease either
credit limit at our discretion. We will notify you in writing on a Credit Voucher, on your statement, or by separate
notice if the amount of either credit limit goes up or down. We may reduce a credit limit, suspend your credit
privileges, close your account or Plan or otherwise terminate your ability to use your Plan. We may do this at any
time and for any reason, subject to applicable law. Your obligations under this Agreement continue even after we
have done this. You may cancel your credit limits established for applicable loans upon written request to BECU.
If your account is suspended, you must immediately return any authorized access devices, including credit cards.
Any use of an account, access device or service after suspension will be considered fraudulent.
7. Promise to Pay. You promise to pay BECU the total of all credit advances on each account (including any
credit advances requested by any co-borrower or by any authorized user of a credit card), finance charges, and
other amounts set forth in this Agreement and any Credit Voucher on the payment terms set forth below. This
includes any requests for payments to a third party or for payment or deposit to your savings or checking account.
Payments must be made in U.S. Dollars.
a. Payment Methods. You promise to make your periodic payment for Line of Credit accounts under this
Agreement by automatic transfer from shares or deposits, and for Card accounts by such automatic transfer
or by direct deposit, personal check, draft, electronic funds transfer, or wire transfer. If you pay by automatic
transfer, you understand that it is your responsibility to be sure that there are adequate funds in your account
to satisfy the payment on the specified date or your loan will become past due. You must make your scheduled
payments on loans under this Agreement regardless of the payment method you select to make payments.
b. Minimum Payment. You agree that, on or before the due date indicated on your periodic statement, you
will pay at least the minimum payment that is required under this Agreement and is specified on the periodic
statement. The method of determining this amount is set forth in Section 2.d of Part B below for a Line of
Credit and Section 12.b of Part C below for a Credit Card.
c. Prepayment and Irregular Payments. You may pay all or part of your loan(s) early, at any time, without
paying any penalty. However, payments in excess of your minimum payment will not relieve you of your
obligation to make your subsequent minimum payments on the dates when due. Instead of advancing your
payment due date, a prepayment or early payment will reduce the principal amounts owing on your account.
BECU reserves the right to refuse partial payments. We may accept late payments, partial payments and
payments marked “payment in full” that are not sent to the following address without losing our rights under this
Agreement. Without losing our rights under this Agreement, we may accept late payments, partial payments
and payments marked “payment in full” that are not sent to the address set forth below.
WITH REGARD TO ANY DISPUTED DEBTS, ALL PAYMENTS OF LESS THAN THE AMOUNTS REQUIRED
UNDER THIS AGREEMENT, INCLUDING ANY CHECK OR INSTRUMENT TENDERED AS FULL
SATISFACTION OF A DEBT, SHALL BE SENT ONLY TO THE ATTENTION OF:
Risk Management Representative – Payment on Disputed Account
BECU
P.O. Box 97050
Seattle, WA 98124-9750
8. Periodic Statements. If your account has an outstanding debit or credit balance in excess of $1 at the end
of a billing cycle/ statement period, we will send you a statement to the address shown in our records reflecting
balances and activity in that account. The amounts shown on your monthly statement as available credit do not
take into account Purchases, Balance Transfers, Cash Advances, interest charges, fees, any other transactions,
or credits which post to your account after the Closing Date of that monthly statement.
9. Lien and Security Agreement
BECU Lien. You agree BECU has a lien on all your shares, deposits, and dividends in all joint and individual
accounts held by you, now and in the future, to the extent of your obligations to BECU. You agree that BECU’s
lien is independent of any security agreement and BECU may enforce its lien in any manner, at any time allowed
by applicable law. You agree that you own any shares pledged and that there are no liens against them other than
4
ours. BECU may, at its sole option, allow you to withdraw a portion of your shares or deposits without affecting its
security interest.
Pledge of Shares, Deposit Accounts and Certificates of Deposit. By completing and signing the Plan
application, you signify your specific intent to pledge to us and to grant us a security interest in all your
individual and joint BECU shares, deposit accounts, and certificates of deposit in which you have an interest,
now or in the future, as security for all credit advances made under the Plan (including the credit card
account). However, this pledge will not apply to retirement or other accounts to the extent that applicable law
precludes the pledge of such accounts, or to loans secured by real property or a dwelling. You agree that
we need not retain or possess any certificate or evidence of account to enforce our security interest. You
authorize us, without further notice to you, to apply the balances in these account(s) to pay any amounts due
under the Plan if you default.
10. Default. You will be in default under this Agreement if any of the following happens on any account:
a. you do not make a payment as required by this Agreement on or before the payment due date;
b. you exceed your credit limit without our permission;
c. you become subject to bankruptcy, incompetency or insolvency proceedings or you die;
d. if we believe (in our sole discretion, subject to applicable law) that there has been an adverse change in your
financial condition or any time we reasonably deem ourselves insecure;
e. you make any untrue statements or omissions or provide false signatures on any application or financial
statement furnished to BECU or fail to provide us financial information we request;
f. your payment is dishonored by your financial institution for any reason;
g. you violate or fail to comply with any term of this Agreement or any other agreement you have with BECU;
h. you default on any loan, account or other obligation that you have with us, including loans which are not part
of the Plan, will constitute default under this Agreement, or
i. you no longer qualify for BECU membership.
11. Upon or Following Default. Upon the occurrence of any event of default under this Agreement, we have the
right, subject to applicable law, to terminate or suspend your credit privileges under this Agreement, to require
repayment and to change the terms of your account and this Agreement. In requiring repayment, we may demand
that you immediately pay the entire unpaid balance of all your loans under your Plan, increase the minimum
payments, and/or may apply any loan account payment to any outstanding account balance under the Plan.
BECU may start a collection action in the county in which BECU is located or where you reside if you live outside
of Washington.
12. Reformation of Fees, Charges and Other Provisions. If any fee or charge, or any portion of any fee or
charge, including but not limited to a finance charge or method of computing a finance charge, or any other
provision of this Agreement, would but for this sentence be unlawful, the language of this Agreement shall be
automatically reformed to eliminate any excessive or unlawful portion of such fee or charge and any such unlawful
provision. In no event shall the fees charged under this agreement exceed the maximum allowed under
applicable state or federal law, nor shall any provision in this Agreement be applied where it would violate any
law, including but not limited to the Military Lending Act. If any other provisions of this Agreement or a related
agreement are deemed unenforceable or invalid, the remaining provisions will remain in full force and effect.
13. Voluntary Payment Protection. We may offer Voluntary Payment Protection to you. Voluntary Payment
Protection is not necessary to obtain credit. If you purchase Voluntary Payment Protection from us, you authorize
us to add the fees monthly to your loan balance and charge you interest on the entire balance. At our option we
may change your payment or the period of time necessary to repay the loan balance. The rate used to determine
the fees may change in the future. If the rate changes, we will provide any notices required by applicable law.
14. Amendments
a. Plan Termination. You or any co-applicant may terminate your Plan at any time by calling us at 206-439-
5700 or, outside Seattle, at 800- 233-2328 or writing us at the address on the first page of this Agreement.
BECU may also terminate your entire Plan or any part of your Plan at any time. All other provisions of this
Agreement shall otherwise remain in full force and effect until you pay all sums due us. You understand that
terminating your Plan will not relieve you of your obligations on any outstanding loan balances at the time of
5
termination.
b. Plan Changes. You agree that BECU may, at any time, change any part of this Agreement (including but
not limited to adding new provisions, deleting existing ones, or changing any other terms and conditions of this
agreement relating to your Plan or account), provided we have given you notice in advance of the change, if
required by law. Any notice of change in terms required by law will be sent to the last address appearing on the
records of BECU, unless you notify us of the change in your address within a reasonable time prior to the notice
being sent.
15. Attorneys’ Fees, and Costs. You agree to pay BECU’s internal and external costs, collection and other
expenses such as expert witnesses, debt collectors, court costs, and reasonable attorneys’ fees and legal
expenses whether or not there is a lawsuit, including attorneys’ fees in any arbitration or mediation, on appeal, in
any bankruptcy (or state receivership or other insolvency proceeding) and in any forfeiture or other proceeding,
except to the extent that a liability for such costs or expenses is limited or prohibited by an applicable state
statute. A Collection Charge will be imposed if we must telephone you, write to you, or make a personal visit
due to any default on your part. All of these costs and expenses may be added to your present debt and a
finance charge may be imposed on them at the highest rate applied to any of your credit advances. The security
provisions in Section 9 of this Part A of the Agreement also secure payment of all these amounts.
16. Enforcement. BECU may delay enforcing any right under this Agreement without losing that right or any other
right. In its sole discretion, BECU may charge and collect a lesser amount than that specified in this Agreement
or in a related agreement or disclosure. The collection of such a lesser amount shall not bar BECU from renewing
the collection of the full amount as so specified. In the event you die, we can collect any amounts outstanding
under your Plan as immediately owed against your estate or against anyone who obtained an advance under your
Plan.
17. Assignment. We have the right to assign and transfer our rights under this Agreement and any amounts you
owe to us. The term “us” shall be deemed to include each and every immediate and successive assignee. You do
not have the right to assign or transfer any of your rights, duties or obligations under this Agreement.
18. Notices. All notices and statements will be sent to the last address appearing on BECU records. You agree
to advise us promptly if you change your mailing address. We can accept address corrections received from the
U.S. Postal Service.
19. Credit Information/Financial Statements.
You authorize us to release information to others regarding the status and history of your Plan. You agree to
provide us upon request at any time with a current financial statement or updated credit information requested in
our sole discretion. You agree we may obtain credit reports, employment or investigative inquiries on you at any
time, at our sole option, for any reason, including but not limited to determining your eligibility for other products
and services or determining whether there has been an adverse change in your financial condition. If you ask, we
will tell you whether or not we requested a credit report and, if we did, we will provide you with the name and
address of the consumer reporting agency that furnished the report.
20. Governing Law. Our approval of this Agreement and of any credit extension or advance under this
Agreement occurs in the state of Washington. This Agreement shall be governed by the Federal laws and the
laws of the state of Washington as they each apply, except to the extent that, notwithstanding federal law, 12
U.S.C. 1785(g)(1), an applicable state statute invalidates this choice of Washington law. In accepting the terms
of this contract, you agree that venue for any action brought by you or brought by us to enforce the terms of the
agreement is properly located in King County, Seattle, Washington, unless an applicable state statute invalidates
such a choice of venue.
B. ADDITIONAL TERMS APPLICABLE TO PERSONAL LINES OF CREDIT
This section contains additional terms and conditions pertaining to the overdraft protection personal line of
credit account (“Line of Credit”). The terms and conditions in this section are in addition to and modify the terms
and conditions of the Plan with respect to Lines of Credit. All other attributes, terms and conditions of the Plan,
including but not limited to the security interest granted under Section 9 of Part A of this Agreement, are not
modified by this section and will also govern your Line of Credit. In the event of an inconsistency between Part A
and this Part B, the terms of this Part B shall prevail.
6
1.Joint Accounts. You understand that any joint account holder on your deposit account with checking account
features, or any person authorized to use an access device for this account may access your Line of Credit and
you and they agree to be jointly and severally liable for such transactions.
2.Promise to Pay
a.Responsibility. By using your account to engage in transactions after we furnish a Credit Voucher to you,
you agree to the credit limit, annual percentage rate, any other applicable fees and charges, and any terms and
conditions set forth in the Credit Voucher, which will be incorporated into and become part of this Agreement
and will govern your Plan. Any person or entity that has accepted, signed, used, or authorized the use of a Line
of Credit under the Plan, regardless of whether this person is named in the application or otherwise, agrees to
be and is bound by the terms of this Agreement.
b.Payment Methods. Your required minimum payment will be made by automatic transfer from your savings
or checking account at BECU. At any time, you may pay additional amounts by such automatic transfer or by
personal check, draft, electronic funds transfer, or wire transfer.
c.Crediting Payments if Not Made by Automatic Transfer. Payments received at BECU, P.O. Box 97050,
Seattle, WA 98124- 9750 at or before 5:00 p.m. Pacific Time on any business day will be credited to your
account as of that date; payments received by mail at that address after 5:00 p.m. Pacific Time, on a weekend
or federal holiday will be posted to your account as of the next business day. Crediting to your account may
be delayed up to five days if payment is received by mail at any other address or if mailed payment is not
accompanied by any remittance slip or statement we provide.
d.Payment—Minimum Amount and Allocation. The Line of Credit minimum payment amount will be the
greater of $25 or 2% of the outstanding balance on your account at the end of the billing cycle statement period,
which begins on the 17th day of the month and ends on the 16th day of the following month (“Ending Balance”).
The Ending Balance does not include late payment fees but includes voluntary payment protection costs,
returned payment fees and the cost of collection and attorneys due to your default. When credit availability is
suspended or terminated, the minimum payment amount will be calculated for the remaining balance at 2%
of the outstanding balance at the time of suspension or termination, and will be fixed at that amount until the
balance is paid in full. Payments will be applied first to late payment fees and other fees and charges (other
than finance charges), then to accrued finance charges, and the remainder, if any, to the balance, unless
otherwise agreed to by BECU or required by applicable law.
3.Finance Charges
a.Penalty Rate. If, on this account or on any account that you have with us, you make any payment that is
returned or your total Minimum Periodic Payment is not paid within 29 days of the payment due date (within
27 days during the February credit reporting period or 28 days for February reporting period in leap years),
twice within any 12 month period, the ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE (APR) will be increased to the lesser
of 19.9% or the highest rate allowed by law, unless this increase in APR as a result of default is invalidated by
a state statute that is applicable notwithstanding federal law, 12 U.S.C. 1785(g)(1). The Daily Periodic Rate
(DPR) in this event shall be the APR divided by 365 (366 in a leap year). If your DPR (and corresponding APR)
is increased as described, it may be subsequently reduced at our discretion after a minimum of twelve months
at which time it is determined that no payment for any amounts owed BECU has been late during the 12-month
period, and your other accounts with BECU are in good standing (current and non-negative). Rate changes
shall be effective beginning on the first day on the next Billing Cycle following the late payment or determination.
A loan whose rate is reduced will be subject to subsequent increases should future payment be missed in a
manner described within this section. If the DPR and corresponding APR increase, the FINANCE CHARGE will
increase and your minimum payment may be higher.
b.Timing of Finance Charges and Payments. You will be obligated to pay a finance charge that will begin to
accrue as of the date on which any credit advance is made. There is no grace period in which you may avoid
incurring a finance charge by paying off the balance. Credit advances may be directly deposited to one of your
deposit accounts and will be subject to a finance charge from the date of deposit even if you do not withdraw
the money immediately. Credit advances and payments made by automatic transfer will be posted to your
account when made. When you make a payment during the period on which your monthly statement is based,
then this statement will specify the amount of interest that you paid.
c.How to Determine Unpaid Daily Balance and Finance Charges. The unpaid daily principal balance
is the amount of outstanding indebtedness that remains unpaid at the close of each business day after all
transactions for the day are posted to your Line of Credit. Transactions are posted by subtracting the amount
of any payments or credits (thus decreasing the balance) and adding the amount of any new advances plus
7
the cost of Voluntary Payment Protection, if any (thus increasing the balance). The daily principal balance will
include any unpaid fees or charges including finance charges, unless otherwise forborne by BECU or prohibited
by applicable law. We multiply this balance by the applicable daily periodic rate to calculate the daily finance
charge, then add this charge to the daily finance charges for the other days in the period on which your monthly
statement is based. The total finance charge is the sum of the daily finance charges during this period.
d. Determination of DPR and Corresponding APR. The DPR and APR for which you initially qualify now
or in the future may depend on your credit qualifications, income, credit or employment history. The DPR and
corresponding APR for each account under the Plan will be set forth in the Credit Voucher that is sent to you.
Your rate on any account is subject to change with additional advances, based on your credit history. BECU
may change the rates it offers from time to time and may review your credit qualifications periodically and adjust
your DPR and corresponding APR based on changes in your credit qualifications. If you receive your initial
Credit Voucher after the time of the initial advance on your account, then you may cancel the Line of Credit
account without obligation if, within four business days of the date of your initial Credit Voucher, you provide
BECU with written notice and return all of the funds that BECU initially advanced to you. If you use or retain the
account funds after that date, you waive any right to cancel this Agreement.
4. Other Account Fees and Charges
a. A Late Payment Fee in an amount equal to $25 or 5% of the minimum payment, whichever is greater, will be
imposed on payments that are not paid or are paid ten (10) or more calendar days after the payment due
date, except to the extent that a Late Payment Fee is allowed only in a lesser amount or after a longer number
of calendar days according to a state statute that is applicable notwithstanding federal law, 12 U.S.C. 1785(g)
(1).
b. A Returned Payment Fee in an amount equal to $25 or the amount of the returned payment, whichever is
smaller, will be imposed if any check, instrument or other item given as payment on your Plan is uncollectible
or is dishonored for any reason, except to the extent that a Returned Payment Fee is allowed only in a lesser
amount according to a state statute that is applicable notwithstanding federal law. Unless otherwise required by
law, we are not obligated to attempt to collect any check more than once.
c. A Collection Charge will be imposed if we must telephone you, write to you, or make a personal visit due to
any default on your part.
5. Advances and Access
a. Limitations on Credit Advances. You will receive a Credit Voucher showing the amount of the credit limit on
your Line of Credit, which is the maximum amount you may draw upon without getting our specific approval for
additional advances. You may access credit on your Line of Credit, repay any portion of the amount borrowed,
and reborrow any portion up to your credit limit from time to time without limitation.
b. Overdraft Access. You may access your Line of Credit by writing drafts, and overdrawing your checking
account or your deposit account with checking account features with us, as specifically designated by you for
overdraft protection. We may, at our sole discretion, access this account on your behalf if you have scheduled
automatic payments for which there are not sufficient collected funds in your checking account or your other
deposit account(s). We will not do this if the advance to cover the scheduled payment would cause your credit
limit to be exceeded. We will treat the overdraft as a request for an advance on your Line of Credit and we will
allow such access subject to the terms of this Agreement. You understand that any owner on your checking
account or your deposit account with checking account features may obligate you to overdraft advances. Line
of Credit overdraft funds transfers will be made in $100 increments (or the unused portion of the available credit
limit if less than $100) and will be transferred to your checking account or your deposit account with checking
account features. You agree not to let the overdrawn balance exceed your approved credit limit. If you fail to
meet any conditions of your checking account or your deposit account with checking account features, we may
cancel your Line of Credit immediately without notice. In any event, you hold us harmless from any and all
liability which might arise if the transfer does not occur. Transfers from deposit accounts will be governed by the
Membership and Account Agreement. Transfers from a Line of Credit will be governed by this Agreement.
c. Suspension of Line. Your ability to draw upon the Line of Credit will be suspended immediately if: (1) the
account specifically designated for overdraft protection by you is closed for any reason; (2) your automatic
payment transfer to your Line of Credit is canceled for any reason; or (3) we determine that no Line of Credit
advances have been made within ninety (90) days from the account establishment or within one (1) year
from the last advance. You may request that your Line of Credit be reinstated, upon re-enrolling for automatic
payment transfer and upon specifically designating a deposit account with checking account features for
overdraft protection.
8
6. Change in Terms (including Finance Charges). You agree that we can change the terms of the Line of Credit
(including but not limited to any of the examples of changes specified in Section 14.b of Part A of this Agreement)
at any time upon proper advance notice to you, where required by law. Changes may apply to both new and
outstanding balances.
7. Closing the Personal Line of Credit. You can cancel or close your account by either calling us at 206-439-
5700 or, outside Seattle, at 800-233-2328 or writing us at the address provided above. If you cancel the Account,
the cancellation will terminate the overdraft protection the Account provides for any linked checking accounts. In
addition, you must pay everything you owe us, including any amounts owed but not yet billed to you. If you do not
pay us immediately, outstanding balances will continue to accrue finance charges and other fees or charges, and
be subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.
C. ADDITIONAL TERMS APPLICABLE TO CREDIT CARDS
This section contains additional terms and conditions pertaining to the credit card account of your Plan (“Card”).
References to “Card” below relate to the account associated with the credit card and not only to transactions
conducted through use of the physical credit card, other credit instrument or device which we supply to you, itself.
The terms and conditions in this section are in addition to and modify the terms and conditions of the Plan. All
other attributes, terms and conditions of the Plan, including but not limited to the security interest granted under
Section 9 of Part A of this Agreement, are not modified by this section and will continue to govern your Card
account. In the event of an inconsistency between Part A and this Part C, the terms of this Part C shall prevail.
1. Responsibility and Applicability of Terms.
Any person or entity that has accepted, signed, used, or authorized the use of a Card under the Plan agrees to
be and is bound by the terms of this Agreement. In this Agreement, the word “Cardholder” means the applicant
and coapplicant(s) for the Plan associated with the Card, and each authorized user of the Card (“User”), whether
named in an application as a User, or otherwise. In this Part C of the Agreement, “you” means the Cardholder(s)
associated with a particular Card account. The following additional definitions apply in this Part C and on your
monthly statement.
New Balance: The sum of all of the unpaid Purchases, Cash Advances, Balance Transfers, finance charges,
late payment fees, and any other fees or charges outstanding on the closing date.
Previous Balance: The sum of all unpaid Purchases, Cash Advances, Balance Transfers, finance charges,
late payment fees, and any other fees and charges at the beginning of the billing cycle (it is the same amount
that was shown as “New Balance” on the closing date on the statement for the preceding billing cycle).
Purchases: Transactions involving advances other than Balance Transfers and Cash Advances. Purchases
may include Foreign Transactions, account charges, and adjustments associated with any transaction.
2. Liability. You will be liable for all credit obtained under your Card by any Cardholder. If there is more than one
Cardholder, then each will be liable, jointly and severally, for all credit obtained through use of the Card. If two or
more persons are responsible to pay any outstanding balance, we may refuse to release any of them from liability
until all of the unexpired Cards issued pursuant to the Plan have been returned to us and the balance is paid
in full. If you request us to issue a Card on your account to another person, or if you allow any person to have
access to your Card or account number with your permission to make a charge, you will be liable for all charges
made by that person, including charges for any Cash Advances or any Purchases from merchants or in amounts
that you may not have intended the person to make. In addition, you will owe us finance charges and other fees
and charges on these transactions, to the same extent as if you made them yourself.
3. Purchases and Cash Advances. Any Cardholder can use the Card for Purchases and Cash Advances. You
may not use the Card for any illegal or unlawful transaction and we may decline to authorize any transaction that
we believe poses an undue risk of illegality or unlawfulness.
4. Balance Transfers. You may use your Card to transfer balances from other accounts to your Card with us
(“Balance Transfer”). You may request a Balance Transfer by completing the balance transfer portion of the credit
application, by completing and returning to us one of the balance transfer requests forms we may send you from
time to time, or by writing or telephoning us. Interest begins to accrue as of the date a balance transfer is posted
to your account. You agree that you will not make Balance Transfers payable to cash, to you, to any individual, to
a deposit account, or to any BECU loan account and, if you do make any such Balance Transfer, BECU reserves
the right to convert the transaction to a Cash Advance.
9
5.Daily Periodic Rate (DPR) and Annual Percentage Rate (APR). The DPR and corresponding APR used to
calculate the FINANCE CHARGE for your Card will be stated in a Credit Voucher provided to you when you
open your credit card account. (That document is a part of this Agreement.) After you open your account, rate
information will be provided in periodic statements, Credit Vouchers, or notices that we send to you.
a.Variable Rates. A variable DPR and APR will be used to calculate the interest charge applicable to your
account, after the expiration of any applicable introductory rate period. The APR will be based on the value
of an index. The index will be the highest U.S. Prime Rate published in the Money Rates section of The Wall
Street Journal on the first business day of each month. This Prime Rate is a reference index and is not the
lowest interest rate available. If The Wall Street Journal does not publish the U.S. Prime Rate, or if it changes
the definition of the U.S. Prime Rate, we may substitute another index, subject to applicable law. To determine
the APR that will apply to your credit card, we will add a margin to the value of the index. The current range
of APRs that can apply is disclosed in the Disclosures. The margin and the corresponding APR applicable to
your account will be stated in a Credit Voucher provided to you when you open your account and thereafter in
Credit Vouchers or notices, and may depend on your credit qualifications, income, credit or employment history,
product selection, or participation in a BECU rewards program. Your APR can change on the first business
day of the billing cycle each month, based on the index rate in effect as of the first day of the prior calendar
month. Increases or decreases in the U.S. Prime Rate will cause increases or decreases in the APR, resulting
in increases or decreases in the interest charge, which in turn will affect the number of monthly minimum
payments that are required to repay the interest due. There is no limit on the amount by which this variable APR
can change in any month.
b.Introductory or Promotional Rate. If you have not previously received a BECU credit card and you
establish a BECU credit card account, you may be eligible for an introductory rate or promotional rate. Any
introductory rate, and the period for which it will be in effect, will be stated on the Credit Voucher provided to you
when you open your credit card account. Any promotional rate, and the period for which it will be in effect, will
be stated in a notice provided to you at the beginning of the promotional rate period. The introductory rate or
promotional rate may be extended by BECU in its discretion.
6.Finance Charges
a.Purchases. A finance charge will be imposed on the portion of purchases that are included in the New
Balance and remain unpaid by the payment due date on your monthly statement, and on purchases made
during the following billing cycle.
b.Cash Advances. Finance charges will be imposed on the aggregate balance including all Cash Advances
as described in Section 7 of this part C (below), starting on the date of the Cash Advance and lasting until paid
in full.
c.Balance Transfers. Finance charges will be imposed on the aggregate balance including all Balance
Transfers as described in Section 7 of this part C (below), starting on the date of the Balance Transfer and
lasting until paid in full.
7.How to Determine Finance Charges:
a.The types of FINANCE CHARGES that may be assessed on your account are daily periodic rate finance
charges and transaction finance charges. Your total FINANCE CHARGES each billing cycle is the sum of each
type of finance charge.
b.Calculation of Finance Charge. All finance charges for Purchases, Cash Advances and Balance Transfers
are added together to calculate the annual percentage rate for each billing cycle.
(i)Calculation of Finance Charges for Cash Advances and Balance Transfers. A Finance Charge on
a Cash Advance or Balance Transfer will be imposed from the date the Cash Advance or Balance Transfer
is posted to your account until paid in full. There is no grace period in which you may avoid incurring a
finance charge by paying off the balance resulting from a Cash Advance or Balance Transfer. We calculate
the Finance Charge by multiplying the Average Daily Balance by the number of days in the billing cycle and
then multiplying by the Daily Periodic Rate. To get the Average Daily Balance attributable to Cash Advances
and Balance Transfers, we take the beginning balance each day, add any new Cash Advances and Balance
Transfers, and subtract any payments, credits posted to your account and unpaid Finance Charges and other
charges. This gives us the daily balance. Then we add up all the daily balances for the billing cycle and divide
the total by the number of days in the billing cycle to determine the Average Daily Balance.
(ii)Calculation of Finance Charges for Purchases. To avoid incurring Finance Charges on the balance of
the Purchases reflected on the statement, you must pay the entire New Balance shown on your statement
on or before the Payment Due Date shown on your statement each month. If you do not pay the entire
10
New Balance on or before the Payment Due Date each month, the unpaid portion of the New Balance will
accrue interest beginning on the first day of the billing cycle in which the payment is due. We calculate the
Finance Charge by multiplying the Average Daily Balance by the number of days in the billing cycle and
then multiplying by the Daily Periodic Rate. We calculate the Average Daily Balance of Purchases by taking
the beginning balance of your account each day that is attributable to Purchases, add any new Purchases
as of the date those charges are posted to your account and subtract any additional payments, credits, and
unpaid Finance Charges and fees or other charges. Then we add up all the daily balances for the billing cycle
and divide the total by the number of days in the billing cycle. If you paid the entire New Balance shown on
the previous monthly statement by the Payment Due Date shown on that statement, the portion of the New
Balance shown on the current statement that is paid by the Payment Due Date shown on that
statement will be excluded from the calculation of the balance each day.
8. Other Account Fees and Charges
a. A Late Payment Fee in an amount equal to $25 or the amount of the late payment, whichever is smaller, will
be imposed on minimum payments not paid by the payment due date, except to the extent that a Late Payment
Fee only in a lesser amount or on a later date is allowed by a state statute that is applicable not withstanding
federal law, 12 U.S.C. 1785(g)(1).
b. A Returned Payment Fee in an amount equal to $25 or the amount of the returned payment, whichever is
smaller, will be imposed if any check, instrument or other item given as payment on your Card is uncollectible
or is dishonored for any reason, except to the extent that a Returned Payment Fee is allowed only in a lesser
amount according to a state statute that is applicable notwithstanding federal law. Unless otherwise required by
law, we do not have to attempt to collect any check more than once.
c. A Card Replacement Fee of $5 may be assessed for each Card lost, stolen or destroyed.
d. A Card Recovery Assessment will be imposed and may be added to your balance if:
1) you use your Card after the Card has been canceled, and 2) we must pay a recovery fee to a third party who
obtains the Card for us.
e. A Collection Charge will be charged if it is necessary to telephone you, write to you, or hire a third party to
make a personal visit due to any default on your part. If a personal visit is necessary, the amount charged will
be the larger of $50 or the cost of the third party’s services.
f. A Stop Payment Fee charge of $5 may be imposed for each stop payment on a Convenience Check.
9. Foreign Transactions and Foreign Exchange. If you use your Card for an International Transaction, the
exchange rate between the transaction currency and the billing currency used for processing International
Transactions will be a rate selected by Visa from the range of rates available in wholesale currency markets
for the applicable central processing date, which rate may vary from the rate Visa itself receives, or the
governmentmandated rate in effect for the applicable central processing date. The currency conversion rate on
the day before the transaction processing date may differ from the rate in effect at the time of the transaction or on
the date the transaction is posted on your account. You agree to accept the converted amount in U.S. dollars.
10. Change in Terms. You agree that we can change the terms of this Agreement (including but not limited to
any of the examples of changes specified in Section 14.b of Part A of this Agreement) at any time upon proper
advance notice to you, where required by law. We consider that you have accepted changes if you keep or use
the card after the notice. The new terms, including an increase or decrease in the finance charges, shall be
effective as to any subsequent credit extended on and after the effective date of the change. New terms other
than an increase in the finance charge shall be effective also as to any unpaid balance outstanding as of the
effective date of the change.
11. Security Interest. In addition to the security interest granted under Section 9 of Part A of this Agreement and
included in the Plan, one or more of the following is applicable as security for amounts outstanding from time to
time in connection with the Card:
a. Deposit Account. If you are issued a secured Card, you have signed or will be required to sign a separate
security agreement pledging a specific, non-withdrawable portion of your shares and/or deposits in BECU to
secure your Card. The amount of the security for such a Card is the amount of your credit limit and you may not
have any access to or control of that amount.
b. Goods Purchased. You hereby grant us a security interest in each item purchased with advances obtained
under this Agreement. This security interest will remain in full force and effect as long as there is an outstanding
balance on the item purchased. If we have the right to demand full payment of your new balance, we may also
11
take possession of this property (you promise to give it to us if we ask) and sell it to satisfy your debts and
obligations. Any outstanding debt will be allocated upon the first-bought, first paid rule. You agree that 10 days is
reasonable time to give you notice of any such sale.
12. The Minimum Periodic Payment Required
a. Payments. Payments received at Card Services, P.O. Box 84707, Seattle WA 98124- 6007 before 5 p.m.
Pacific Time on any business day will be credited to your Card as of that date; payments received on or after
5 p.m. Pacific Time, on a weekend or federal holiday will be credited as of the next business day. Crediting a
payment may be delayed up to five days if the payment is received at any other address or not accompanied by
the remittance portion of the monthly statement for your Card. If the circumstances and attributes of a payment
demonstrate a significant probability that a payment is fraudulent, then available credit on the Card account will
not be increased during up to six (6) additional business days after such a payment is submitted for clearance.
b. Payment—Minimum Amount and Allocation. If you elect not to pay your New Balance in full, you must
make a payment according to the following schedule on or before the due date shown on your statement. If the
New Balance is less than $25, your minimum payment will be the full balance; if this balance is $25 to $1,000
your minimum payment will be $25; if this balance is more than $1,000 your minimum payment will be 2½% of
this balance rounded down to the nearest whole dollar. A credit posting from a merchant or reversal of fees do
not constitute any part of a minimum payment. The minimum payment will be allocated at BECU’s discretion to
pay off lower rate balances, such as promotional offers, before higher rate balances, such as Cash Advances or
Purchases. Payments in excess of the minimum payment will be allocated to pay off higher rate balances first.
All outstanding balances from the previous month’s statement must be fully paid before any part of a payment
will be applied to transactions that occurred during the current billing cycle. From time to time, we may allow you
to skip your Minimum Periodic Payment due. If you choose to skip that payment, FINANCE CHARGES, and
voluntary payment protection costs, if any, will continue to accrue in accordance with this Agreement.
c. Past Due and Overlimit Amounts. In addition to the above, the minimum payment will also include the
greater of any amount past due or any amount by which the New Balance exceeds the approved credit limit for
the account. If your account is past due, and/or overlimit, that amount of the minimum payment is immediately
due.
d. Payment in Full. The payment of a New Balance in full will not eliminate the need to make a minimum
payment for the next billing cycle if there are new purchases or cash transactions in the next billing cycle.
13. Lost, Stolen, or Unauthorized Use of Your Card. You agree to notify us immediately, orally or in writing, of
the loss, theft, or unauthorized use of your Card. We may investigate any cases of unauthorized use of your Card.
We may terminate or limit access to your Card if you have notified us or we have determined that your Card or
convenience checks may have been lost or stolen, or that there may be unauthorized access to your Card. Unless
you have been negligent or have engaged in fraud, you will not be liable for any unauthorized transactions using
your lost or stolen Card. If you are liable for unauthorized transactions, your liability will not exceed $50. You will
not be liable for unauthorized transactions that occur after you notify us at:
BECU, P.O. Box 97050,
Seattle, WA 98124-9750
Telephone:
206-439-5700 or outside Seattle at 800-233-2328

Call 800-449-7728
14. Additional Provisions
a. Visa Account Updater. BECU may use the Visa Account Updater (VAU) service, which would automatically
update your card-on-file information at participating merchants, for example sending updates about replacement
account numbers if your card is lost or stolen. BECU reserves the right to terminate or suspend, or reinstate,
the functioning of the VAU service for one or more individual Visa accounts or for all Visa accounts, in BECU’s
discretion at any time, and without prior notice. If you have questions about the VAU service or would like to
opt out of this service, please call one of the phone numbers listed in Section 13 above, or write to the address
stated there. Opt-outs are completed within 5-7 business days after request.
12
b. Recurring Merchant Transactions. If you authorize a merchant to charge your account for repeat
transactions with your Card, you must notify the merchant when you want to discontinue the repeat
transactions, including when your Card account is closed or a new Card number is issued by us, and you must
monitor your periodic statements to be vigilant for unauthorized recurring transactions with merchants who
participate in the VAU service described above. You may opt out of the VAU service to block all participating
merchants from receiving your updated account information.
c. Ownership of Cards. Any Card is our property and must be returned to us or our agent, immediately upon
demand. If we ask, you will destroy the Card by cutting it in half and will surrender it to us or our agent, mail it to
us, or take it to a location we designate.
d. Honoring of Card. We will not be responsible for the failure or refusal of anyone to honor the Card. Although
your New Balance may be less than your credit limit, we may fail or decline to authorize a particular transaction
due to the failure of a communications or computer system, due to other operational difficulties or due to issues
particular to your account, including your default of any agreement with us, an adverse change in your financial
situation, an amendment or termination of your participation in the Plan or, at our discretion, other reasons that
we deem to be appropriate.
e. Transfer of Card. You cannot transfer your Card to any other person, although you will be liable for any use
by anyone else that has been authorized by you or another Cardholder.
f. Transactions with Internet Merchants. In order to make transactions over the internet, merchants may
request your Verified by Visa password to complete the transaction. If a password is not provided, the merchant
may deny the transaction. If the password is incorrect, we may deny the transaction.
g. Merchant Return Policy. If a merchant discloses a policy such as “no returns,” “no refund”, “no return or
credit without receipt”, “as is”, “store credit only”, or “all sales final”, you will be bound by that policy when you
use your Card to buy goods or services from that merchant.
h. Merchant Refunds. If a seller agrees to give you a refund or adjustment, you will accept a credit to your
Card in lieu of a cash refund.
i. Merchant Reservations. When using your account to make travel or lodging reservations, obtain the
merchant’s cancellation policy and follow it if you cancel. If you cancel, obtain the merchant’s cancellation
number that it is required to give you. The merchant may charge you for a canceled transaction unless you can
provide us with the merchant’s cancellation number.
j. Merchant Dispute Assistance. If you disagree with a transaction on your statement or have a dispute with
the merchant as a result of the transaction, you will provide information or assistance we reasonably request
to permit us to investigate the transaction. Otherwise, you will pay us for any resulting loss we have (up to the
amount of the transaction) unless we are prohibited by applicable law from holding you liable for our loss. If any
provision of this paragraph conflicts with any part of the “Your Billing Rights” disclosure below that is applicable
to the particular transaction, the terms of the “Your Billing Rights” disclosure will control.
k. Transactions. For statement verification, you will retain your copy of each receipt (ticket/draft) resulting
from each Purchase, Cash Advance, or other transaction on your Card. We will provide you with documentary
evidence of each transaction upon your reasonable request or upon proper written notice of a billing error. (See
Section 8.e of this Part C for cost information.)
l. Phone Inquiries. Inquiries regarding your Card may be made by calling BECU at 206- 439-5700 or, outside
Seattle at 800-233-2328 or by writing us at the address provided below.
m. Our Address. Please address all other correspondence, letters and notices (excluding payments) with
respect to Cards to us at: BECU P.O. Box 97050, Seattle, WA 98124 or Customer Service P.O. Box 31112
Tampa, Florida 33631-3112.
n. Inactivity. BECU reserves the right to terminate the credit if there are no transactions in one year.
o. Non-Activation. If the Cardholder fails to activate the Card within 30 calendar days after the card is sent to
the Cardholder, BECU reserves the right to cancel your account.
p. Closing your Account. You can cancel or close your account by either calling us at 206- 439-5700 or, outside
Seattle at 800-233- 2328 or writing us at the address provided above. If you cancel the Account, you must pay
everything you owe us, including any amounts owed but not yet billed to you. If you do not pay us immediately,
outstanding balances will continue to accrue finance charges and other fees or charges, and be subject to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement. You also agree to return to us or destroy your Card(s) and any unused
Convenience Checks. You agree that you will not attempt to make a Purchase or Cash Advance after you have been
notified of your or our termination or suspension of your credit privileges. You further understand and agree that it is
13
your sole responsibility to terminate your authorization of all reoccurring transactions you may have scheduled with
merchants or other third parties.
15.BECU REWARDS PROGRAM OPTION.
You may elect to add a BECU rewards program (“Program”) to your Card account. Upon enrolling in a Program,
you agree to accept the terms, conditions and rules for the Program that are in addition to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement and which otherwise govern your Card. The terms, conditions and rules for the
Program become effective immediately upon our receipt and acknowledgment of your instructions to enroll you in
the Program, and will apply only to the purchases of goods and services made with your Card after that effective
date. If you were already a cardholder before you enrolled and your enrollment results in an increase in the
margin applicable to your account, then BECU will send you a notice showing the increased margin and
corresponding increased Annual Percentage Rate and the effective date of such changes.
II.YOUR BILLING RIGHTS
Your Billing Rights: Keep this Document for Future Use
This notice tells you about your rights and our responsibilities under the Fair Credit Billing Act.
What To Do If You Find a Mistake on Your Statement
If you think there is an error on your credit card statement, write to us at either:
BECU
P.O. Box 97050
Seattle, WA 98124
Customer Service
P.O. Box 31112
Tampa, FL 33631-3112
If you think there is an error on your personal line of credit statement, write to us at:
Research and Adjustments
P.O. Box 97050
Seattle, WA 98124-97050
In your letter, give us the following information:
•Account information: Your name and account number.
•Dollar amount: The dollar amount of the suspected error.
•Description of problem: If you think there is an error on your bill, describe what you believe is wrong and why
you believe it is a mistake.
You must contact us:
•Within 60 days after the error appeared on your statement.
•At least 3 business days before an automated payment is scheduled if you want to stop payment on the
amount you think is wrong.
You must notify us of any potential errors in writing. You may call us, but if you do we are not required to
investigate any potential errors and you may have to pay the amount in question.
What Will Happen After We Receive Your Letter
When we receive your letter, we must do two things:
1.Within 30 days of receiving your letter, we must tell you that we received your letter. We will also tell you if we
have already corrected the error.
2.Within 90 days of receiving your letter, we must either correct the error or explain to you why we believe the
bill is correct.
While we investigate whether or not there has been an error:
•We cannot try to collect the amount in question, or report you as delinquent on that amount.
14
•The charge in question may remain on your statement, and we may continue to charge you interest on that
amount.
•While you do not have to pay the amount in question, you are responsible for the remainder of your balance.
•We can apply any unpaid amount against your credit limit.
After we finish our investigation, one of two things will happen:
•If we made a mistake: You will not have to pay the amount in question or any interest or other fees related to
that amount.
•If we do not believe there was a mistake: You will have to pay the amount in question, along with applicable
interest and fees. We will send you a statement of the amount you owe and the date payment is due. We may
then report you as delinquent if you do not pay the amount we think you owe. If you receive our explanation but
still believe your bill is wrong, you must write to us within 10 days telling us that you still refuse to pay. If you do
so, we cannot report you as delinquent without also reporting that you are questioning your bill. We must tell
you the name of anyone to whom we reported you as delinquent, and we must let those organizations know
when the matter has been settled between us. If we do not follow all of the rules above, you do not have to pay
the first $50 of the amount you question even if your bill is correct.
Your Rights If You Are Dissatisfied With Your Credit Card Purchases
If you are dissatisfied with the goods or services that you have purchased with your credit card, and you have
tried in good faith to correct the problem with the merchant, you may have the right not to pay the remaining
amount due on the purchase.
To use this right, all of the following must be true:
1.The purchase must have been made in your home state or within 100 miles of your current mailing address,
and the purchase price must have been more than $50.
(Note: Neither of these are necessary if your purchase was based on an advertisement we mailed to you, or if
we own the company that sold you the goods or services.)
2.You must have used your credit card for the purchase. Purchases made with cash advances from an ATM or with
a check that accesses your credit card account do not qualify.
3.You must not yet have fully paid for the purchase.
If all of the criteria above are met and you are still dissatisfied with the purchase, contact us in writing at:
Customer Service
P.O. Box 31112
Tampa, FL 33631-3112.
While we investigate, the same rules apply to the disputed amount as discussed above. After we finish our
investigation, we will tell you our decision. At that point, if we think you owe an amount and you do not pay, we
may report you as delinquent.

Table of Contents Membership/Savings/Checking Disclosure Statement
Membership
This agreement applies to all aspects of membership, including all accounts, products, and services
and all requests and applications for accounts, products, and services. Upon verification of eligibility
following submission of a completed membership application and acceptance for membership by the
membership officer, and upon purchase of at least one share ($5), a Membership Savings Account
will be established in your name, indicating that you are a Member-owner of Navy Federal Credit
Union (Navy Federal). Membership at Navy Federal comes with certain ongoing responsibilities. By
signing your original membership application, you and your joint owner(s), if any, agree to abide
by the properly disclosed terms and conditions of all accounts or services that you may receive at
Navy Federal. You also agree to keep Navy Federal informed of your current mailing address. The
terms and conditions of these accounts and services are subject to change without notice to you,
unless prior notification is required by law.
Membership/Savings/Checking Disclosure Statement ....................................................... 1 A balance of at least one share ($5) is required to establish and maintain membership. The balance
in your Membership Savings Account must not be reduced below the value of one share ($5) at any

180 consecutive days, the Membership Savings Account may be closed, thereby terminating your

What Does Navy Federal Do With Your Personal Information?........................................16 Account balance of $50 or more; have a Membership Savings Account balance of $5 or more and a
checking account, a Money Market Savings Account (MMSA), a certificate, an Individual Retirement
Account, a credit card account, an additional savings account, or a current consumer loan or mortgage
account; or have a Membership Savings Account balance of $5 or more and are a Member under the
age of 24. If you do not meet one of the above criteria, you will be considered an inactive Member
and may be subject to a quarterly Inactive Member Fee in the amount listed on Navy Federal’s current
Schedule of Fees and Charges. The fee will be assessed until you meet one of the criteria listed
above or the Membership Savings Account is closed, thereby terminating your membership. Once this
happens, you must be in Navy Federal’s field of membership to reopen the account.
A savings account may not be used for commercial or business purposes.
Restriction of Services
Navy Federal may restrict or suspend access by a Member to any or all products or services,
except the basic rights of a Member to vote in annual and special meetings and maintain a share
account, if a Member engages in conduct that is abusive to the credit union and its membership.
This conduct includes, but is not limited to, actions that abuse the products or services of the
credit union; abusive or threatening behavior; and suspicious, fraudulent, illegal, dishonest,
or deceptive activities. Restrictions or suspensions of accounts, products, and/or services will
be reasonably related to the nature of the Member’s conduct. This policy will also apply to joint
owners and authorized users of accounts, products, and services. When a Member is delinquent
on a loan or has caused Navy Federal a loss, Navy Federal may deny that Member’s subsequent
application for any new product or service that would allow the Member to obtain further credit from
Navy Federal or cause Navy Federal a further loss. Pursuant to Navy Federal’s bylaws and the Federal
Credit Union Act, Members may be expelled at a special meeting called for the purpose of expelling
those Members.
Other Limitations of Services
Your access to any services described herein or otherwise offered to you may be limited due to
system outages, errors, backlogs, or suspected fraud or illegal activity—to the extent allowed
by law—in order to maintain or restore security or performance to said systems. There are many
reasons we may decline or prevent transactions to or from your account, but generally we do this
to protect you, us, and our membership as a whole, or to comply with legal requirements. We may
decline or prevent any or all transactions to or from your account. We may refuse, freeze, reverse,
or delay any specific withdrawal, payment, transfer of funds, deposits (check, ACH, or wires), credit,
or debit to or from your account, or we may remove funds from your account to hold them pending
investigations, including in one or more of the following circumstances:
• Your account is involved in any legal or administrative proceeding;
• We receive conflicting information or instructions regarding account ownership, control, or activity;
• We suspect that you may be the victim of a fraud, scam, or financial exploitation, even though
you have authorized the transaction(s);
• We suspect that any transaction may involve illegal activity; be fraudulent; or, after having made
funds available, may reasonably result in uncollected funds;

Newsweek
The ranking was given on November 19, 2024, and was based on data taken from Navy Federal Investment Services’ SEC filings as of September 2024.  Newsweek in conjunction with Plant -A Insights Group created and tabulated this rating. No compensation has been provided directly or indirectly by Navy Federal Investment Services, LLC in connection with obtaining or using this Newsweek rating.
Read the full list on Newsweek’s website.
About the Newsweek Ranking
Methodology
Plant-A Insights Group and Newsweek have partnered to identify America's Top Financial Advisory Firms 2025. We analyzed over 15,000 Financial advisories registered with the SEC, and then applied the following methodology to identify the best of the best.
We began by shortlisting firms with more than $20 million assets under management (AUM), a minimum of 3 wealth advisors, at least 5 individual clients, and at least two years of SEC registration. Firms were also screened for clean disciplinary records and availability of portfolio management services to individual investors. These shortlisted firms were then analyzed and scored based on the following factors:
Asset Performance: Growth in assets under management indicates both financial performance and the health of a firm's client base, the cornerstones of advisory excellence. We include both short-term (Sept 2024 vs Sept 2023) and long-term (CAGR Sept 2019 to Sept 2024) measures of asset growth in our scoring model.
Client Performance: Great advisories retain their clients and attract new ones. We again include both short and long-term measures of client base growth/shrinkage for short term (Sept 2024 vs Sept 2023) and long term (CAGR Sept 2019 to Sept 2024).
Adviser Expertise and Client Ratio: We include measures that capture the credentialed expertise of each firm as well as their client-to-adviser ratio.
Breadth of service offerings: Great firms offer a bundle of related services for their investors. We considered the number of other wealth advisory services in our scoring model, such as financial planning services and pension consulting services.
Conflicts of interests: The best advisories work to prevent conflicts of interest; firms with conflicts of interests are penalized in the scoring model.
We calculate a score for each firm. The top 750 Financial Advisory Firms have been recognized as America's Top Financial Advisory Firms 2025. The performance of firms not included in the ranking is not disputed.

Personal Loans
Personal Loans FAQs
Personal Loan Basics
What can I use a personal loan for?
From covering unexpected expenses to paying for home improvements and more, a personal loan can be used for many miscellaneous needs that don’t have their own specific loan categories. They can provide flexibility and quick access to funds.
Can I use a personal loan for higher education?
No, a personal loan doesn’t cover education expenses. However, our
student loans
can help you pay for college or refinance your current student loans.
Do I need a co-applicant?
No, it isn’t necessary to have a co-applicant. But, depending on your situation, a co-applicant may help you meet the credit requirements necessary for loan approval.
Can I get a personal loan if I have limited credit history?
Yes, but a co-applicant may be required, depending on the requested loan terms.
How is interest calculated on personal loans?
We calculate interest daily using the simple interest method. That means we calculate interest on the unpaid principal balance from the date of receipt of the last payment until the date of receipt of the current payment.
How are payments applied?
Each time a payment is received, we first pay off the interest that has accrued since the date of your last payment. The remaining amount goes toward your principal balance. So if you pay more than the minimum amount due, the funds reduce the loan balance and are applied as a partial payment toward the next regular payment.
Does Navy Federal offer small dollar loans?
We offer personal loans for as little as $250 and 6-month terms with no fees and a maximum of 18% APR, as an alternative to a small dollar loan program and payday loans.
Can I borrow more than $50,000 for a personal loan?
Yes! However, if the amount you need to borrow falls within the range of $50,001 to $150,000 for a personal expense loan, home improvement loan or debt consolidation, you'll need to apply at a
branch
or by calling us at
1-888-842-6328
, and you'll need a qualifying co-applicant. There won't be collateral required and no change to the ""as low as"" rates advertised for a personal loan. Loans up to $50,000 can be applied for online or through our mobile app.
Footnote
1
Applying for a Personal Loan
What type of information do you collect when I apply for a personal loan?
We’ll need the following details for you and any co-applicant:
contact information (phone number and email)
current housing, employment and income information
amount expected to finance
length (term) of the desired loan
Does Navy Federal charge a fee to apply for a loan?
No, Navy Federal doesn’t charge a personal loan application fee.
If my personal loan application isn’t automatically approved, can I still sign my Promissory Note electronically?
Yes. Email notifications are sent with directions on how to electronically sign your Promissory Note.
What if I run out of time to sign the Promissory Note electronically?
If you’re unable to electronically sign your Promissory Note by the specified date, we’ll automatically mail paper loan documents to your address on record.
How long does it take to receive my funds?
Once your loan is approved, you’ll have same-day access to funds in most cases.
Managing Your Personal Loan
When will my first payment be due?
Your first payment will be due on a date set by Navy Federal, 30 to 60 days from when the loan is finalized. You’ll find your first due date on your Promissory Note or loan contract.
Can I change my payment due date?
No, loan payment due dates cannot be modified.
What information is available in my monthly loan statement?
Your loan statement provides timely details about your account. You can get information about how much you owe and what you’ve already paid. Find out more to better
understand your loan statement
.
How do I set up automatic payments to my personal loan?
Sign in to your account and select Transfers. You can schedule transfers from your checking or savings accounts, or even an external account.
How do I add an external account so I can make my payments to Navy Federal?
You can set up an external account through our mobile app or online banking.
From the Mobile App:
Sign in and tap on Transfers on the bottom navigation menu
Tap View/Add Accounts
Tap on + at the top right of the screen
Tap External Financial Institution
Provide information in all fields and tap Continue
Confirm information and tap Add Account
Retrieve confirmation code by email and tap Activate
Tap Done
How do I view monthly statements for my personal loan?
You can access your monthly Consumer Loan Statements anytime by signing in to your account. Statements are available for up to 36 months and appear in PDF format, making it easy for you to print or save. You can also update your statement delivery preference so that you no longer receive paper statements. And, if you’ve signed up for automatic or recurring payments, you won’t receive paper statements. You can re-register for paper statements at any time.
How do I switch to paperless statements for my personal loan?
We make it simple. Get the guidance you need to
make the switch
.
Where can I get the payoff amount for my personal loan?
Sign in to digital banking.
Select Loans & Credit on your Accounts page.
Select the Personal Loan link listed there.
Choose the Additional Account Information drop-down.
How can I pay off my personal loan?
There are a few ways you can pay off your personal loan:
Pay using digital banking
Call a stateside member rep at 1-888-842-6328
Visit a branch for in-person assistance
Will there be a penalty if I pay off my loan early?
No. If you pay off your loan early, there’s no penalty. Remember, before you apply a lump-sum payment to your loan’s principal balance to pay it off, you must pay all accrued unpaid interest, charges or fees that might be outstanding.
Can I designate a payment as a principal reduction payment?
No. Payments are applied first to unpaid interest, then to the principal balance. Payments more than the minimum amount due will reduce the loan balance but are a partial payment toward the next payment due.
It’s helpful to make extra payments to your loan anytime. That way, you’ll pay off the loan early and with less interest over the life of the loan.
What happens if I pay more than the minimum payment?
If you pay more than the amount due, we’ll count any extra funds as a partial payment toward your next payment due. Depending on how much extra you pay, your next due date could be a month or more in the future. Interest accrues daily, regardless of the due date, so you can save on interest by continuing to pay extra.
Where can I see how my payments are applied?
Using digital banking, view the Transaction Detail. Each payment shows the date the payment was applied, the amount applied to principal and the amount applied to interest. A printed version of the payment history can also be requested through member service channels.
Debt Consolidation Loan
What can I use a debt consolidation loan for?
You can use debt consolidation loans to merge several types of debt into one fixed monthly payment, including:
auto loans
credit cards
medical debt
payday loans
personal loans
While a debt consolidation loan doesn’t erase your debt, using this kind of loan can make paying off your debt simpler and sometimes even less expensive. Managing one loan payment can help you to stay on top of your bills.
Savings Secured Loan
What is a savings secured loan?
A savings secured loan uses the value of your existing savings account to back your loan. It allows you to borrow money for most purposes while leaving the funds in your savings account in place, so it can earn dividends. Savings secured loans are also a great way to build credit.
Will Navy Federal pull my credit if I apply for a savings secured loan?
No. We don’t require a credit report check for a savings secured loan.
I see 2 balances. What do they mean?
Your savings account displays 2 balances: your current balance (how much is in your savings as of the previous day's close of business) and your available balance (how much is available for you to use at that time).
What happens after I'm approved for the loan?
After being approved for savings secured loan, a hold will be placed on the available balance in your savings account in the amount you’re applying for.
What will happen to my balance as I make payments?
As you make payments, your available balance will increase by your payment amount minus this payment’s interest due. Funds are released 24 to 48 hours after a payment is made.
Will I continue to earn dividends?
Yes, you’ll continue to earn dividends on the full current balance in your savings account.
Certificate Secured Loan
What is a certificate secured loan?
A certificate secured loan uses the value of your existing certificates to back your loan. It allows you to borrow money for most purposes while leaving the funds in your certificate account in place where it can earn dividends. A certificate secured loan is also a great way to build credit.
Will Navy Federal pull my credit for a certificate secured loan?
No. We don’t require a credit report check for a certificate secured loan.

Need Flexible Cash?
Our personal loan options are a fast, convenient, and affordable way to borrow money and can meet many needs - from planning a wedding or scheduling a once-in-a-lifetime vacation to consolidating high-interest debt or paying off medical expenses.
Why Choose a Personal Loan?
If you need a large chunk of cash all at once, a Personal Loan can help you get it, with amounts from $1,000 to $20,000. Our Personal Loans are:
Fast.
You'll receive a quick decision and get the loan funds in your account within days, if approved.
Affordable.
Our simple repayment plan depends on the amount you borrow and your term length.
Accessible.
A Personal Loan is an unsecured loan, meaning you don't have to pledge anything, like a car or a home, as security.

Personal Loan FAQs
Personal Loan Basics
What’s a personal loan?
A personal loan is an unsecured loan with a fixed rate and payment. You pay the loan back in monthly installments. It provides financial flexibility and quick access to cash with no collateral required, plus no application, origination or early prepayment fees. If approved, you’ll receive a lump sum of money in your checking or savings account to use for practically anything.
What can I use a personal loan for?
Whatever you'd like! Debt consolidation, home renovations and big expenses are common ways that personal loans are used, but you're not limited to those. You could get the funds you need for medical expenses, taxes, weddings, adoptions, IVF and more.
Can I use a personal loan to pay off my credit cards?
Yes! You can use a personal loan to pay off any high-interest credit cards and combine your debt into a single loan with a predictable, fixed payment each month. It’s an easy way to simplify your finances and possibly pay less interest each month so you can build your savings.
What’s the difference between a personal loan and a debt consolidation loan?
A personal loan is a single unsecured loan with a fixed rate and payment while a debt consolidation loan is a type of personal loan that combines multiple debts into a single loan with a fixed monthly payment, interest rate and repayment term.
Applying for a Personal Loan
How can I apply for a personal loan?
You can
apply online
or in the mobile app
Footnote
2
. After signing in to your account, you can apply for a personal loan in just a few minutes. There's no fee to apply and most decisions take just a few seconds. You can also apply over the phone at
1-888-842-6328
or at a branch.
How long will take for me to get a decision?
In most cases, decisions on personal loans take just a few seconds. However, there’s no guarantee that the loan will be approved.
How much will my monthly payment be?
Calculate
your estimated monthly payments based on your assumptions for loan amount, interest rate and loan term. Your actual rates and payments may differ from the estimates provided by this calculator as a result of qualifying for a different loan amount, term, and rate; your actual creditworthiness; and our pricing and underwriting policies and guidelines. You’ll get your actual rate and payment amount upon an approved application.
What if rates change after my approval?
You’re protected. Our personal loans come with a fixed interest rate that never changes throughout the loan term, no matter what happens with the prime rate or federal funds rate. When the Fed changes its benchmark interest rate, Navy Federal may also change our rates. In a low-rate environment, you could save on interest costs by applying for another personal loan and pay off your current loan if approved at a lower rate.
What’s my debt-to-income ratio (DTI)?
This is a comparison of your monthly debt, including your new personal loan, to your monthly income. Many lenders prefer borrowers with a low DTI ratio because it means you’re more likely to be able to afford your monthly payments.
What are the fees associated with a personal loan?
A late payment fee will be charged if you don't make your monthly loan payments on-time. Otherwise, there are no application or originations fees with a Navy Federal personal loan. Plus, there are no prepayment penalties if the loan is paid off early. If you do not pay your loan on time, a late payment fee will be charged.
Personal Loan Eligibility and Approval
What does it take to be eligible for a personal loan?
You need to become a member before you can apply and must be at least 18 years old.
Learn more about joining Navy Federal.
When reviewing your application, several factors are considered, such as credit history and income. Loan approval is not guaranteed.
My personal loan was denied. What are my options?
If you were recently denied for a personal loan, review your adverse action notice to get a better understanding of why. You should also review your credit report to check for any inaccuracies. Easily monitor, manage and help your credit score with our

Frequently Asked Questions
How does the LevelUp rate reduction program work?
As you make strides on improving your credit and paying down loans, we want to be there as your partner. For members that don’t qualify for our best loan rates, we offer this special opportunity as you make on-time payments.
By simply paying your personal loan on time and consistently, we’ll automatically lower your rate up to 0.50% each year. These rate reductions can reduce the amount of interest charged, pay down the principal loan balance faster, and save you money over the life of your loan.

APR (Annual Percentage Rate) Rates offered effective 04/01/2025.
and are subject to credit approval. APRs range based on factors including credit type, loan term, Commitment Household/account relationship and applicant credit worthiness/score. Loan terms are based on various factors, including the amount financed. Actual rates are disclosed to approved applicants in writing prior to loan consummation.
Offered
rates subject to change. For more information, visit patelco.org, call 800.358.8228, or stop by a branch.
The APR range is 9.30% to 17.90% with terms available from 6 to 84 months. Example, if you receive a loan of $10,000 with an interest rate of 9.30% with no origination fee and make 36 monthly payments of $320.41, your finances charges will be $1,534.39 which would make your total repayment amount $11,534.39.

Patelco runs a “soft” credit pull to determine which pre-qualification offer you qualify for. This doesn’t affect your credit score. If you choose to proceed with a loan application, Patelco will request your full credit report from one or more credit reporting agencies. This will be a “hard” pull and may affect your credit. If necessary, we may also share certain information about you with third parties, like our insurers, to process your request.

LevelUp is offered to members who are approved for Patelco’s credit tier 2 or higher on a personal loan. Total discount of up to 1.50% APR (Annual Percentage Rate) applied in 0.50% APR increments for every 12 consecutive on-time monthly payments. Maximum discount will never cause the final APR to be lower than the LevelUp floor rate for the specific loan and term at time of funding. Monthly payment amount remains constant, with additional money going toward principal, which shortens the term of the loan and the total amount paid over the life of the loan.

Frequently Asked Questions
How do I qualify for a personal loan?
Your loan application will be evaluated based upon several factors, including the information provided by you and the credit bureaus, and your demonstrated ability to repay the loan.
How is the APR calculated?
Rates are set based on credit score(s), loan amount and term.
What is the difference between a hard credit pull and a soft credit pull?
A hard inquiry is captured on your credit report and indicates to other financial organizations that you have applied for credit. It may also impact your credit score. A soft inquiry does not impact your credit score and can only be seen by you if you request a copy of your credit report. Soft pulls have no impact on your credit score. To apply for a personal loan, BECU requires a hard credit pull.
Do I need to have collateral?
A personal loan is unsecured and does not require any collateral.
How long will it take to receive the funds?
After submitting the application, most members will have a loan decision within 24 hours. In some cases, additional information may be needed before a credit decision can be made.
If your loan is approved, you will receive a Loan Agreement requesting your signature. Once the loan agreement has been signed and returned the funds will be deposited into a BECU deposit account.
How do I pay off other debt I’m consolidating?
Depending on the selection at funding, your money will either be deposited into your bank account or sent directly to your creditors.

Your final APR may differ from your loan interest rate due to additional fees that may apply. Actual APR will be based on applicant creditworthiness, loan amount, and loan term and may be higher than the lowest rate advertised above. Loan program offered including rates, terms, and conditions are subject to change without notice.

I.CREDIT AND SECURITY AGREEMENT
A.PERSONAL LINE OF CREDIT AND CREDIT CARD
This Credit and Security Agreement (“Agreement”), which includes Truth in Lending Act and Fair Credit Billing
Disclosures, governs your consumer loan plan (“Plan”) with Boeing Employees’ Credit Union (“BECU”). Your Plan
involves open-end personal line of credit and credit card extensions of credit for personal, family, or household
purposes. In this Agreement the words “you,” and “your” mean any person who signs in acceptance of the Plan
and the words “we,” “us,” and “our” mean BECU. When you sign as a loan applicant, you agree, jointly and
severally with any other person who signs as a loan applicant (thus establishing a “Joint Plan”), to be bound by
all the terms and conditions set out in this Credit and Security Agreement, as amended from time to time, in any
credit voucher and in any disclosures or statements of terms and conditions accompanying any access devices
given with any future credit advances, which shall collectively govern your Plan and are incorporated herein by
reference. While you may not have requested or been approved for a particular advance or device under your
Plan, you agree that if at any time in the future you request or are approved for any such credit advance or device,
your relationship with BECU for that account will be governed by these agreements.
1.How the Plan Works. The Plan is an open-end credit plan, including either or both a personal line of credit
or credit card. We contemplate that, from time to time, you will use your Plan to borrow money from us (“credit
advance”). To borrow under the Plan you must activate each of the Plan’s credit accounts individually. You may
do this by submitting a credit request as explained below. If your request is approved, we will furnish you with a
credit voucher providing information about your credit limit, annual percentage rate, any other applicable fees or
charges, and any additional terms and conditions. In this Agreement, the capitalized word “Credit Voucher” means
the document titled “Credit Voucher and Opening Disclosures” for a personal line of credit loan (“Line of Credit”)
or “BECU Visa Credit Voucher and Opening Disclosures” for a Visa® credit card (“Card”).
2.Plan Accounts. The BECU Consumer Lending Rates and Related Disclosures (the “Disclosures”) include
important information about the credit extensions and advances we offer (called “accounts” or “loans”) and
includes the range of rates that may be imposed under the Plan. Certain account transactions under the Plan,
such as line of credit advances or credit card transactions, are also subject to additional terms described later in
this Agreement that may vary from the general Plan terms set out below.
In this Agreement, the capitalized word “Loans” means extensions of credit under your Line of Credit
and/or Card.
3.Account Establishment and Access. You may submit a credit request in any manner authorized by us.
When you sign as a loan applicant on BECU’s Master Credit Application, BECU will establish a Plan under which
you may, at your option, request to establish personal line of credit and/or credit card accounts. When you have
multiple active Plans (for example, a Joint Plan with one co-applicant and another Joint Plan with a different
co-applicant) and you make a credit request, it is your responsibility to inform us under which of these Plans to
establish your account. From the date of the Plan application, we may require that you update the information
you submitted to us when you established your Plan in order for us to evaluate your credit request. If you already
have a Line of Credit and you request and qualify for a Credit Card, or if you already have a Credit Card and you
request and qualify for a Line of Credit, we will establish a new account under your Plan. We are not required
to establish an account under the Plan when you submit a credit request, and we may also refuse an advance
request at any time.
4.Joint Plans. Each time you submit a credit application for another personal line of credit and/or credit card with
a different co-applicant, you request that another Joint Plan be established for you. You understand and agree
that while a Joint Plan is in effect, you and the co-applicant of the Joint Plan: (a) has each authorized the other to
individually request, authorize, or receive credit advances; (b) has each agreed to be jointly and severally liable
for repayment of all amounts owed and for any loans obtained; and (c) has each agreed to all of the loan terms
and conditions, even if you did not specifically authorize or request the credit advance or receive any benefit from
it. If any one of you does not wish any future loans under the Plan or is unwilling to be personally liable for them,
any one of you must write to BECU to terminate the Plan and the termination will be effective as to all of you.
5.Summary of Joint Plan Consequences.
After credit approval, each of your joint applicants shall have the right to use any account under a Joint Plan to
the full extent of any credit limit set by BECU for the Joint Plan, and you will be liable for all amounts of credit
3
extended under this account to all of your joint applicants.
6. Credit Limit. If we establish a Line of Credit and/or Card account in response to your credit request, we also
will establish a credit limit on this account and may establish a separate credit limit on cash advances from this
account. You agree not to attempt to obtain more credit than the amount of the applicable credit limit. If you
temporarily exceed your credit limit, you understand such credit does not increase your credit limit and you agree
to pay us that excess amount and applicable finance charges, immediately. We can increase or decrease either
credit limit at our discretion. We will notify you in writing on a Credit Voucher, on your statement, or by separate
notice if the amount of either credit limit goes up or down. We may reduce a credit limit, suspend your credit
privileges, close your account or Plan or otherwise terminate your ability to use your Plan. We may do this at any
time and for any reason, subject to applicable law. Your obligations under this Agreement continue even after we
have done this. You may cancel your credit limits established for applicable loans upon written request to BECU.
If your account is suspended, you must immediately return any authorized access devices, including credit cards.
Any use of an account, access device or service after suspension will be considered fraudulent.
7. Promise to Pay. You promise to pay BECU the total of all credit advances on each account (including any
credit advances requested by any co-borrower or by any authorized user of a credit card), finance charges, and
other amounts set forth in this Agreement and any Credit Voucher on the payment terms set forth below. This
includes any requests for payments to a third party or for payment or deposit to your savings or checking account.
Payments must be made in U.S. Dollars.
a. Payment Methods. You promise to make your periodic payment for Line of Credit accounts under this
Agreement by automatic transfer from shares or deposits, and for Card accounts by such automatic transfer
or by direct deposit, personal check, draft, electronic funds transfer, or wire transfer. If you pay by automatic
transfer, you understand that it is your responsibility to be sure that there are adequate funds in your account
to satisfy the payment on the specified date or your loan will become past due. You must make your scheduled
payments on loans under this Agreement regardless of the payment method you select to make payments.
b. Minimum Payment. You agree that, on or before the due date indicated on your periodic statement, you
will pay at least the minimum payment that is required under this Agreement and is specified on the periodic
statement. The method of determining this amount is set forth in Section 2.d of Part B below for a Line of
Credit and Section 12.b of Part C below for a Credit Card.
c. Prepayment and Irregular Payments. You may pay all or part of your loan(s) early, at any time, without
paying any penalty. However, payments in excess of your minimum payment will not relieve you of your
obligation to make your subsequent minimum payments on the dates when due. Instead of advancing your
payment due date, a prepayment or early payment will reduce the principal amounts owing on your account.
BECU reserves the right to refuse partial payments. We may accept late payments, partial payments and
payments marked “payment in full” that are not sent to the following address without losing our rights under this
Agreement. Without losing our rights under this Agreement, we may accept late payments, partial payments
and payments marked “payment in full” that are not sent to the address set forth below.
WITH REGARD TO ANY DISPUTED DEBTS, ALL PAYMENTS OF LESS THAN THE AMOUNTS REQUIRED
UNDER THIS AGREEMENT, INCLUDING ANY CHECK OR INSTRUMENT TENDERED AS FULL
SATISFACTION OF A DEBT, SHALL BE SENT ONLY TO THE ATTENTION OF:
Risk Management Representative – Payment on Disputed Account
BECU
P.O. Box 97050
Seattle, WA 98124-9750
8. Periodic Statements. If your account has an outstanding debit or credit balance in excess of $1 at the end
of a billing cycle/ statement period, we will send you a statement to the address shown in our records reflecting
balances and activity in that account. The amounts shown on your monthly statement as available credit do not
take into account Purchases, Balance Transfers, Cash Advances, interest charges, fees, any other transactions,
or credits which post to your account after the Closing Date of that monthly statement.
9. Lien and Security Agreement
BECU Lien. You agree BECU has a lien on all your shares, deposits, and dividends in all joint and individual
accounts held by you, now and in the future, to the extent of your obligations to BECU. You agree that BECU’s
lien is independent of any security agreement and BECU may enforce its lien in any manner, at any time allowed
by applicable law. You agree that you own any shares pledged and that there are no liens against them other than
4
ours. BECU may, at its sole option, allow you to withdraw a portion of your shares or deposits without affecting its
security interest.
Pledge of Shares, Deposit Accounts and Certificates of Deposit. By completing and signing the Plan
application, you signify your specific intent to pledge to us and to grant us a security interest in all your
individual and joint BECU shares, deposit accounts, and certificates of deposit in which you have an interest,
now or in the future, as security for all credit advances made under the Plan (including the credit card
account). However, this pledge will not apply to retirement or other accounts to the extent that applicable law
precludes the pledge of such accounts, or to loans secured by real property or a dwelling. You agree that
we need not retain or possess any certificate or evidence of account to enforce our security interest. You
authorize us, without further notice to you, to apply the balances in these account(s) to pay any amounts due
under the Plan if you default.
10. Default. You will be in default under this Agreement if any of the following happens on any account:
a. you do not make a payment as required by this Agreement on or before the payment due date;
b. you exceed your credit limit without our permission;
c. you become subject to bankruptcy, incompetency or insolvency proceedings or you die;
d. if we believe (in our sole discretion, subject to applicable law) that there has been an adverse change in your
financial condition or any time we reasonably deem ourselves insecure;
e. you make any untrue statements or omissions or provide false signatures on any application or financial
statement furnished to BECU or fail to provide us financial information we request;
f. your payment is dishonored by your financial institution for any reason;
g. you violate or fail to comply with any term of this Agreement or any other agreement you have with BECU;
h. you default on any loan, account or other obligation that you have with us, including loans which are not part
of the Plan, will constitute default under this Agreement, or
i. you no longer qualify for BECU membership.
11. Upon or Following Default. Upon the occurrence of any event of default under this Agreement, we have the
right, subject to applicable law, to terminate or suspend your credit privileges under this Agreement, to require
repayment and to change the terms of your account and this Agreement. In requiring repayment, we may demand
that you immediately pay the entire unpaid balance of all your loans under your Plan, increase the minimum
payments, and/or may apply any loan account payment to any outstanding account balance under the Plan.
BECU may start a collection action in the county in which BECU is located or where you reside if you live outside
of Washington.
12. Reformation of Fees, Charges and Other Provisions. If any fee or charge, or any portion of any fee or
charge, including but not limited to a finance charge or method of computing a finance charge, or any other
provision of this Agreement, would but for this sentence be unlawful, the language of this Agreement shall be
automatically reformed to eliminate any excessive or unlawful portion of such fee or charge and any such unlawful
provision. In no event shall the fees charged under this agreement exceed the maximum allowed under
applicable state or federal law, nor shall any provision in this Agreement be applied where it would violate any
law, including but not limited to the Military Lending Act. If any other provisions of this Agreement or a related
agreement are deemed unenforceable or invalid, the remaining provisions will remain in full force and effect.
13. Voluntary Payment Protection. We may offer Voluntary Payment Protection to you. Voluntary Payment
Protection is not necessary to obtain credit. If you purchase Voluntary Payment Protection from us, you authorize
us to add the fees monthly to your loan balance and charge you interest on the entire balance. At our option we
may change your payment or the period of time necessary to repay the loan balance. The rate used to determine
the fees may change in the future. If the rate changes, we will provide any notices required by applicable law.
14. Amendments
a. Plan Termination. You or any co-applicant may terminate your Plan at any time by calling us at 206-439-
5700 or, outside Seattle, at 800- 233-2328 or writing us at the address on the first page of this Agreement.
BECU may also terminate your entire Plan or any part of your Plan at any time. All other provisions of this
Agreement shall otherwise remain in full force and effect until you pay all sums due us. You understand that
terminating your Plan will not relieve you of your obligations on any outstanding loan balances at the time of
5
termination.
b. Plan Changes. You agree that BECU may, at any time, change any part of this Agreement (including but
not limited to adding new provisions, deleting existing ones, or changing any other terms and conditions of this
agreement relating to your Plan or account), provided we have given you notice in advance of the change, if
required by law. Any notice of change in terms required by law will be sent to the last address appearing on the
records of BECU, unless you notify us of the change in your address within a reasonable time prior to the notice
being sent.
15. Attorneys’ Fees, and Costs. You agree to pay BECU’s internal and external costs, collection and other
expenses such as expert witnesses, debt collectors, court costs, and reasonable attorneys’ fees and legal
expenses whether or not there is a lawsuit, including attorneys’ fees in any arbitration or mediation, on appeal, in
any bankruptcy (or state receivership or other insolvency proceeding) and in any forfeiture or other proceeding,
except to the extent that a liability for such costs or expenses is limited or prohibited by an applicable state
statute. A Collection Charge will be imposed if we must telephone you, write to you, or make a personal visit
due to any default on your part. All of these costs and expenses may be added to your present debt and a
finance charge may be imposed on them at the highest rate applied to any of your credit advances. The security
provisions in Section 9 of this Part A of the Agreement also secure payment of all these amounts.
16. Enforcement. BECU may delay enforcing any right under this Agreement without losing that right or any other
right. In its sole discretion, BECU may charge and collect a lesser amount than that specified in this Agreement
or in a related agreement or disclosure. The collection of such a lesser amount shall not bar BECU from renewing
the collection of the full amount as so specified. In the event you die, we can collect any amounts outstanding
under your Plan as immediately owed against your estate or against anyone who obtained an advance under your
Plan.
17. Assignment. We have the right to assign and transfer our rights under this Agreement and any amounts you
owe to us. The term “us” shall be deemed to include each and every immediate and successive assignee. You do
not have the right to assign or transfer any of your rights, duties or obligations under this Agreement.
18. Notices. All notices and statements will be sent to the last address appearing on BECU records. You agree
to advise us promptly if you change your mailing address. We can accept address corrections received from the
U.S. Postal Service.
19. Credit Information/Financial Statements.
You authorize us to release information to others regarding the status and history of your Plan. You agree to
provide us upon request at any time with a current financial statement or updated credit information requested in
our sole discretion. You agree we may obtain credit reports, employment or investigative inquiries on you at any
time, at our sole option, for any reason, including but not limited to determining your eligibility for other products
and services or determining whether there has been an adverse change in your financial condition. If you ask, we
will tell you whether or not we requested a credit report and, if we did, we will provide you with the name and
address of the consumer reporting agency that furnished the report.
20. Governing Law. Our approval of this Agreement and of any credit extension or advance under this
Agreement occurs in the state of Washington. This Agreement shall be governed by the Federal laws and the
laws of the state of Washington as they each apply, except to the extent that, notwithstanding federal law, 12
U.S.C. 1785(g)(1), an applicable state statute invalidates this choice of Washington law. In accepting the terms
of this contract, you agree that venue for any action brought by you or brought by us to enforce the terms of the
agreement is properly located in King County, Seattle, Washington, unless an applicable state statute invalidates
such a choice of venue.
B. ADDITIONAL TERMS APPLICABLE TO PERSONAL LINES OF CREDIT
This section contains additional terms and conditions pertaining to the overdraft protection personal line of
credit account (“Line of Credit”). The terms and conditions in this section are in addition to and modify the terms
and conditions of the Plan with respect to Lines of Credit. All other attributes, terms and conditions of the Plan,
including but not limited to the security interest granted under Section 9 of Part A of this Agreement, are not
modified by this section and will also govern your Line of Credit. In the event of an inconsistency between Part A
and this Part B, the terms of this Part B shall prevail.
6
1.Joint Accounts. You understand that any joint account holder on your deposit account with checking account
features, or any person authorized to use an access device for this account may access your Line of Credit and
you and they agree to be jointly and severally liable for such transactions.
2.Promise to Pay
a.Responsibility. By using your account to engage in transactions after we furnish a Credit Voucher to you,
you agree to the credit limit, annual percentage rate, any other applicable fees and charges, and any terms and
conditions set forth in the Credit Voucher, which will be incorporated into and become part of this Agreement
and will govern your Plan. Any person or entity that has accepted, signed, used, or authorized the use of a Line
of Credit under the Plan, regardless of whether this person is named in the application or otherwise, agrees to
be and is bound by the terms of this Agreement.
b.Payment Methods. Your required minimum payment will be made by automatic transfer from your savings
or checking account at BECU. At any time, you may pay additional amounts by such automatic transfer or by
personal check, draft, electronic funds transfer, or wire transfer.
c.Crediting Payments if Not Made by Automatic Transfer. Payments received at BECU, P.O. Box 97050,
Seattle, WA 98124- 9750 at or before 5:00 p.m. Pacific Time on any business day will be credited to your
account as of that date; payments received by mail at that address after 5:00 p.m. Pacific Time, on a weekend
or federal holiday will be posted to your account as of the next business day. Crediting to your account may
be delayed up to five days if payment is received by mail at any other address or if mailed payment is not
accompanied by any remittance slip or statement we provide.
d.Payment—Minimum Amount and Allocation. The Line of Credit minimum payment amount will be the
greater of $25 or 2% of the outstanding balance on your account at the end of the billing cycle statement period,
which begins on the 17th day of the month and ends on the 16th day of the following month (“Ending Balance”).
The Ending Balance does not include late payment fees but includes voluntary payment protection costs,
returned payment fees and the cost of collection and attorneys due to your default. When credit availability is
suspended or terminated, the minimum payment amount will be calculated for the remaining balance at 2%
of the outstanding balance at the time of suspension or termination, and will be fixed at that amount until the
balance is paid in full. Payments will be applied first to late payment fees and other fees and charges (other
than finance charges), then to accrued finance charges, and the remainder, if any, to the balance, unless
otherwise agreed to by BECU or required by applicable law.
3.Finance Charges
a.Penalty Rate. If, on this account or on any account that you have with us, you make any payment that is
returned or your total Minimum Periodic Payment is not paid within 29 days of the payment due date (within
27 days during the February credit reporting period or 28 days for February reporting period in leap years),
twice within any 12 month period, the ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE (APR) will be increased to the lesser
of 19.9% or the highest rate allowed by law, unless this increase in APR as a result of default is invalidated by
a state statute that is applicable notwithstanding federal law, 12 U.S.C. 1785(g)(1). The Daily Periodic Rate
(DPR) in this event shall be the APR divided by 365 (366 in a leap year). If your DPR (and corresponding APR)
is increased as described, it may be subsequently reduced at our discretion after a minimum of twelve months
at which time it is determined that no payment for any amounts owed BECU has been late during the 12-month
period, and your other accounts with BECU are in good standing (current and non-negative). Rate changes
shall be effective beginning on the first day on the next Billing Cycle following the late payment or determination.
A loan whose rate is reduced will be subject to subsequent increases should future payment be missed in a
manner described within this section. If the DPR and corresponding APR increase, the FINANCE CHARGE will
increase and your minimum payment may be higher.
b.Timing of Finance Charges and Payments. You will be obligated to pay a finance charge that will begin to
accrue as of the date on which any credit advance is made. There is no grace period in which you may avoid
incurring a finance charge by paying off the balance. Credit advances may be directly deposited to one of your
deposit accounts and will be subject to a finance charge from the date of deposit even if you do not withdraw
the money immediately. Credit advances and payments made by automatic transfer will be posted to your
account when made. When you make a payment during the period on which your monthly statement is based,
then this statement will specify the amount of interest that you paid.
c.How to Determine Unpaid Daily Balance and Finance Charges. The unpaid daily principal balance
is the amount of outstanding indebtedness that remains unpaid at the close of each business day after all
transactions for the day are posted to your Line of Credit. Transactions are posted by subtracting the amount
of any payments or credits (thus decreasing the balance) and adding the amount of any new advances plus
7
the cost of Voluntary Payment Protection, if any (thus increasing the balance). The daily principal balance will
include any unpaid fees or charges including finance charges, unless otherwise forborne by BECU or prohibited
by applicable law. We multiply this balance by the applicable daily periodic rate to calculate the daily finance
charge, then add this charge to the daily finance charges for the other days in the period on which your monthly
statement is based. The total finance charge is the sum of the daily finance charges during this period.
d. Determination of DPR and Corresponding APR. The DPR and APR for which you initially qualify now
or in the future may depend on your credit qualifications, income, credit or employment history. The DPR and
corresponding APR for each account under the Plan will be set forth in the Credit Voucher that is sent to you.
Your rate on any account is subject to change with additional advances, based on your credit history. BECU
may change the rates it offers from time to time and may review your credit qualifications periodically and adjust
your DPR and corresponding APR based on changes in your credit qualifications. If you receive your initial
Credit Voucher after the time of the initial advance on your account, then you may cancel the Line of Credit
account without obligation if, within four business days of the date of your initial Credit Voucher, you provide
BECU with written notice and return all of the funds that BECU initially advanced to you. If you use or retain the
account funds after that date, you waive any right to cancel this Agreement.
4. Other Account Fees and Charges
a. A Late Payment Fee in an amount equal to $25 or 5% of the minimum payment, whichever is greater, will be
imposed on payments that are not paid or are paid ten (10) or more calendar days after the payment due
date, except to the extent that a Late Payment Fee is allowed only in a lesser amount or after a longer number
of calendar days according to a state statute that is applicable notwithstanding federal law, 12 U.S.C. 1785(g)
(1).
b. A Returned Payment Fee in an amount equal to $25 or the amount of the returned payment, whichever is
smaller, will be imposed if any check, instrument or other item given as payment on your Plan is uncollectible
or is dishonored for any reason, except to the extent that a Returned Payment Fee is allowed only in a lesser
amount according to a state statute that is applicable notwithstanding federal law. Unless otherwise required by
law, we are not obligated to attempt to collect any check more than once.
c. A Collection Charge will be imposed if we must telephone you, write to you, or make a personal visit due to
any default on your part.
5. Advances and Access
a. Limitations on Credit Advances. You will receive a Credit Voucher showing the amount of the credit limit on
your Line of Credit, which is the maximum amount you may draw upon without getting our specific approval for
additional advances. You may access credit on your Line of Credit, repay any portion of the amount borrowed,
and reborrow any portion up to your credit limit from time to time without limitation.
b. Overdraft Access. You may access your Line of Credit by writing drafts, and overdrawing your checking
account or your deposit account with checking account features with us, as specifically designated by you for
overdraft protection. We may, at our sole discretion, access this account on your behalf if you have scheduled
automatic payments for which there are not sufficient collected funds in your checking account or your other
deposit account(s). We will not do this if the advance to cover the scheduled payment would cause your credit
limit to be exceeded. We will treat the overdraft as a request for an advance on your Line of Credit and we will
allow such access subject to the terms of this Agreement. You understand that any owner on your checking
account or your deposit account with checking account features may obligate you to overdraft advances. Line
of Credit overdraft funds transfers will be made in $100 increments (or the unused portion of the available credit
limit if less than $100) and will be transferred to your checking account or your deposit account with checking
account features. You agree not to let the overdrawn balance exceed your approved credit limit. If you fail to
meet any conditions of your checking account or your deposit account with checking account features, we may
cancel your Line of Credit immediately without notice. In any event, you hold us harmless from any and all
liability which might arise if the transfer does not occur. Transfers from deposit accounts will be governed by the
Membership and Account Agreement. Transfers from a Line of Credit will be governed by this Agreement.
c. Suspension of Line. Your ability to draw upon the Line of Credit will be suspended immediately if: (1) the
account specifically designated for overdraft protection by you is closed for any reason; (2) your automatic
payment transfer to your Line of Credit is canceled for any reason; or (3) we determine that no Line of Credit
advances have been made within ninety (90) days from the account establishment or within one (1) year
from the last advance. You may request that your Line of Credit be reinstated, upon re-enrolling for automatic
payment transfer and upon specifically designating a deposit account with checking account features for
overdraft protection.

6. Change in Terms (including Finance Charges). You agree that we can change the terms of the Line of Credit
(including but not limited to any of the examples of changes specified in Section 14.b of Part A of this Agreement)
at any time upon proper advance notice to you, where required by law. Changes may apply to both new and
outstanding balances.
7. Closing the Personal Line of Credit. You can cancel or close your account by either calling us at 206-439-
5700 or, outside Seattle, at 800-233-2328 or writing us at the address provided above. If you cancel the Account,
the cancellation will terminate the overdraft protection the Account provides for any linked checking accounts. In
addition, you must pay everything you owe us, including any amounts owed but not yet billed to you. If you do not
pay us immediately, outstanding balances will continue to accrue finance charges and other fees or charges, and
be subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.
C. ADDITIONAL TERMS APPLICABLE TO CREDIT CARDS
This section contains additional terms and conditions pertaining to the credit card account of your Plan (“Card”).
References to “Card” below relate to the account associated with the credit card and not only to transactions
conducted through use of the physical credit card, other credit instrument or device which we supply to you, itself.
The terms and conditions in this section are in addition to and modify the terms and conditions of the Plan. All
other attributes, terms and conditions of the Plan, including but not limited to the security interest granted under
Section 9 of Part A of this Agreement, are not modified by this section and will continue to govern your Card
account. In the event of an inconsistency between Part A and this Part C, the terms of this Part C shall prevail.
1. Responsibility and Applicability of Terms.
Any person or entity that has accepted, signed, used, or authorized the use of a Card under the Plan agrees to
be and is bound by the terms of this Agreement. In this Agreement, the word “Cardholder” means the applicant
and coapplicant(s) for the Plan associated with the Card, and each authorized user of the Card (“User”), whether
named in an application as a User, or otherwise. In this Part C of the Agreement, “you” means the Cardholder(s)
associated with a particular Card account. The following additional definitions apply in this Part C and on your
monthly statement.
New Balance: The sum of all of the unpaid Purchases, Cash Advances, Balance Transfers, finance charges,
late payment fees, and any other fees or charges outstanding on the closing date.
Previous Balance: The sum of all unpaid Purchases, Cash Advances, Balance Transfers, finance charges,
late payment fees, and any other fees and charges at the beginning of the billing cycle (it is the same amount
that was shown as “New Balance” on the closing date on the statement for the preceding billing cycle).
Purchases: Transactions involving advances other than Balance Transfers and Cash Advances. Purchases
may include Foreign Transactions, account charges, and adjustments associated with any transaction.
2. Liability. You will be liable for all credit obtained under your Card by any Cardholder. If there is more than one
Cardholder, then each will be liable, jointly and severally, for all credit obtained through use of the Card. If two or
more persons are responsible to pay any outstanding balance, we may refuse to release any of them from liability
until all of the unexpired Cards issued pursuant to the Plan have been returned to us and the balance is paid
in full. If you request us to issue a Card on your account to another person, or if you allow any person to have
access to your Card or account number with your permission to make a charge, you will be liable for all charges
made by that person, including charges for any Cash Advances or any Purchases from merchants or in amounts
that you may not have intended the person to make. In addition, you will owe us finance charges and other fees
and charges on these transactions, to the same extent as if you made them yourself.
3. Purchases and Cash Advances. Any Cardholder can use the Card for Purchases and Cash Advances. You
may not use the Card for any illegal or unlawful transaction and we may decline to authorize any transaction that
we believe poses an undue risk of illegality or unlawfulness.
4. Balance Transfers. You may use your Card to transfer balances from other accounts to your Card with us
(“Balance Transfer”). You may request a Balance Transfer by completing the balance transfer portion of the credit
application, by completing and returning to us one of the balance transfer requests forms we may send you from
time to time, or by writing or telephoning us. Interest begins to accrue as of the date a balance transfer is posted
to your account. You agree that you will not make Balance Transfers payable to cash, to you, to any individual, to
a deposit account, or to any BECU loan account and, if you do make any such Balance Transfer, BECU reserves
the right to convert the transaction to a Cash Advance.
9
5.Daily Periodic Rate (DPR) and Annual Percentage Rate (APR). The DPR and corresponding APR used to
calculate the FINANCE CHARGE for your Card will be stated in a Credit Voucher provided to you when you
open your credit card account. (That document is a part of this Agreement.) After you open your account, rate
information will be provided in periodic statements, Credit Vouchers, or notices that we send to you.
a.Variable Rates. A variable DPR and APR will be used to calculate the interest charge applicable to your
account, after the expiration of any applicable introductory rate period. The APR will be based on the value
of an index. The index will be the highest U.S. Prime Rate published in the Money Rates section of The Wall
Street Journal on the first business day of each month. This Prime Rate is a reference index and is not the
lowest interest rate available. If The Wall Street Journal does not publish the U.S. Prime Rate, or if it changes
the definition of the U.S. Prime Rate, we may substitute another index, subject to applicable law. To determine
the APR that will apply to your credit card, we will add a margin to the value of the index. The current range
of APRs that can apply is disclosed in the Disclosures. The margin and the corresponding APR applicable to
your account will be stated in a Credit Voucher provided to you when you open your account and thereafter in
Credit Vouchers or notices, and may depend on your credit qualifications, income, credit or employment history,
product selection, or participation in a BECU rewards program. Your APR can change on the first business
day of the billing cycle each month, based on the index rate in effect as of the first day of the prior calendar
month. Increases or decreases in the U.S. Prime Rate will cause increases or decreases in the APR, resulting
in increases or decreases in the interest charge, which in turn will affect the number of monthly minimum
payments that are required to repay the interest due. There is no limit on the amount by which this variable APR
can change in any month.
b.Introductory or Promotional Rate. If you have not previously received a BECU credit card and you
establish a BECU credit card account, you may be eligible for an introductory rate or promotional rate. Any
introductory rate, and the period for which it will be in effect, will be stated on the Credit Voucher provided to you
when you open your credit card account. Any promotional rate, and the period for which it will be in effect, will
be stated in a notice provided to you at the beginning of the promotional rate period. The introductory rate or
promotional rate may be extended by BECU in its discretion.
6.Finance Charges
a.Purchases. A finance charge will be imposed on the portion of purchases that are included in the New
Balance and remain unpaid by the payment due date on your monthly statement, and on purchases made
during the following billing cycle.
b.Cash Advances. Finance charges will be imposed on the aggregate balance including all Cash Advances
as described in Section 7 of this part C (below), starting on the date of the Cash Advance and lasting until paid
in full.
c.Balance Transfers. Finance charges will be imposed on the aggregate balance including all Balance
Transfers as described in Section 7 of this part C (below), starting on the date of the Balance Transfer and
lasting until paid in full.
7.How to Determine Finance Charges:
a.The types of FINANCE CHARGES that may be assessed on your account are daily periodic rate finance
charges and transaction finance charges. Your total FINANCE CHARGES each billing cycle is the sum of each
type of finance charge.
b.Calculation of Finance Charge. All finance charges for Purchases, Cash Advances and Balance Transfers
are added together to calculate the annual percentage rate for each billing cycle.
(i)Calculation of Finance Charges for Cash Advances and Balance Transfers. A Finance Charge on
a Cash Advance or Balance Transfer will be imposed from the date the Cash Advance or Balance Transfer
is posted to your account until paid in full. There is no grace period in which you may avoid incurring a
finance charge by paying off the balance resulting from a Cash Advance or Balance Transfer. We calculate
the Finance Charge by multiplying the Average Daily Balance by the number of days in the billing cycle and
then multiplying by the Daily Periodic Rate. To get the Average Daily Balance attributable to Cash Advances
and Balance Transfers, we take the beginning balance each day, add any new Cash Advances and Balance
Transfers, and subtract any payments, credits posted to your account and unpaid Finance Charges and other
charges. This gives us the daily balance. Then we add up all the daily balances for the billing cycle and divide
the total by the number of days in the billing cycle to determine the Average Daily Balance.
(ii)Calculation of Finance Charges for Purchases. To avoid incurring Finance Charges on the balance of
the Purchases reflected on the statement, you must pay the entire New Balance shown on your statement
on or before the Payment Due Date shown on your statement each month. If you do not pay the entire
10
New Balance on or before the Payment Due Date each month, the unpaid portion of the New Balance will
accrue interest beginning on the first day of the billing cycle in which the payment is due. We calculate the
Finance Charge by multiplying the Average Daily Balance by the number of days in the billing cycle and
then multiplying by the Daily Periodic Rate. We calculate the Average Daily Balance of Purchases by taking
the beginning balance of your account each day that is attributable to Purchases, add any new Purchases
as of the date those charges are posted to your account and subtract any additional payments, credits, and
unpaid Finance Charges and fees or other charges. Then we add up all the daily balances for the billing cycle
and divide the total by the number of days in the billing cycle. If you paid the entire New Balance shown on
the previous monthly statement by the Payment Due Date shown on that statement, the portion of the New
Balance shown on the current statement that is paid by the Payment Due Date shown on that
statement will be excluded from the calculation of the balance each day.
8. Other Account Fees and Charges
a. A Late Payment Fee in an amount equal to $25 or the amount of the late payment, whichever is smaller, will
be imposed on minimum payments not paid by the payment due date, except to the extent that a Late Payment
Fee only in a lesser amount or on a later date is allowed by a state statute that is applicable not withstanding
federal law, 12 U.S.C. 1785(g)(1).
b. A Returned Payment Fee in an amount equal to $25 or the amount of the returned payment, whichever is
smaller, will be imposed if any check, instrument or other item given as payment on your Card is uncollectible
or is dishonored for any reason, except to the extent that a Returned Payment Fee is allowed only in a lesser
amount according to a state statute that is applicable notwithstanding federal law. Unless otherwise required by
law, we do not have to attempt to collect any check more than once.
c. A Card Replacement Fee of $5 may be assessed for each Card lost, stolen or destroyed.
d. A Card Recovery Assessment will be imposed and may be added to your balance if:
1) you use your Card after the Card has been canceled, and 2) we must pay a recovery fee to a third party who
obtains the Card for us.
e. A Collection Charge will be charged if it is necessary to telephone you, write to you, or hire a third party to
make a personal visit due to any default on your part. If a personal visit is necessary, the amount charged will
be the larger of $50 or the cost of the third party’s services.
f. A Stop Payment Fee charge of $5 may be imposed for each stop payment on a Convenience Check.
9. Foreign Transactions and Foreign Exchange. If you use your Card for an International Transaction, the
exchange rate between the transaction currency and the billing currency used for processing International
Transactions will be a rate selected by Visa from the range of rates available in wholesale currency markets
for the applicable central processing date, which rate may vary from the rate Visa itself receives, or the
governmentmandated rate in effect for the applicable central processing date. The currency conversion rate on
the day before the transaction processing date may differ from the rate in effect at the time of the transaction or on
the date the transaction is posted on your account. You agree to accept the converted amount in U.S. dollars.
10. Change in Terms. You agree that we can change the terms of this Agreement (including but not limited to
any of the examples of changes specified in Section 14.b of Part A of this Agreement) at any time upon proper
advance notice to you, where required by law. We consider that you have accepted changes if you keep or use
the card after the notice. The new terms, including an increase or decrease in the finance charges, shall be
effective as to any subsequent credit extended on and after the effective date of the change. New terms other
than an increase in the finance charge shall be effective also as to any unpaid balance outstanding as of the
effective date of the change.
11. Security Interest. In addition to the security interest granted under Section 9 of Part A of this Agreement and
included in the Plan, one or more of the following is applicable as security for amounts outstanding from time to
time in connection with the Card:
a. Deposit Account. If you are issued a secured Card, you have signed or will be required to sign a separate
security agreement pledging a specific, non-withdrawable portion of your shares and/or deposits in BECU to
secure your Card. The amount of the security for such a Card is the amount of your credit limit and you may not
have any access to or control of that amount.
b. Goods Purchased. You hereby grant us a security interest in each item purchased with advances obtained
under this Agreement. This security interest will remain in full force and effect as long as there is an outstanding
balance on the item purchased. If we have the right to demand full payment of your new balance, we may also
11
take possession of this property (you promise to give it to us if we ask) and sell it to satisfy your debts and
obligations. Any outstanding debt will be allocated upon the first-bought, first paid rule. You agree that 10 days is
reasonable time to give you notice of any such sale.
12. The Minimum Periodic Payment Required
a. Payments. Payments received at Card Services, P.O. Box 84707, Seattle WA 98124- 6007 before 5 p.m.
Pacific Time on any business day will be credited to your Card as of that date; payments received on or after
5 p.m. Pacific Time, on a weekend or federal holiday will be credited as of the next business day. Crediting a
payment may be delayed up to five days if the payment is received at any other address or not accompanied by
the remittance portion of the monthly statement for your Card. If the circumstances and attributes of a payment
demonstrate a significant probability that a payment is fraudulent, then available credit on the Card account will
not be increased during up to six (6) additional business days after such a payment is submitted for clearance.
b. Payment—Minimum Amount and Allocation. If you elect not to pay your New Balance in full, you must
make a payment according to the following schedule on or before the due date shown on your statement. If the
New Balance is less than $25, your minimum payment will be the full balance; if this balance is $25 to $1,000
your minimum payment will be $25; if this balance is more than $1,000 your minimum payment will be 2½% of
this balance rounded down to the nearest whole dollar. A credit posting from a merchant or reversal of fees do
not constitute any part of a minimum payment. The minimum payment will be allocated at BECU’s discretion to
pay off lower rate balances, such as promotional offers, before higher rate balances, such as Cash Advances or
Purchases. Payments in excess of the minimum payment will be allocated to pay off higher rate balances first.
All outstanding balances from the previous month’s statement must be fully paid before any part of a payment
will be applied to transactions that occurred during the current billing cycle. From time to time, we may allow you
to skip your Minimum Periodic Payment due. If you choose to skip that payment, FINANCE CHARGES, and
voluntary payment protection costs, if any, will continue to accrue in accordance with this Agreement.
c. Past Due and Overlimit Amounts. In addition to the above, the minimum payment will also include the
greater of any amount past due or any amount by which the New Balance exceeds the approved credit limit for
the account. If your account is past due, and/or overlimit, that amount of the minimum payment is immediately
due.
d. Payment in Full. The payment of a New Balance in full will not eliminate the need to make a minimum
payment for the next billing cycle if there are new purchases or cash transactions in the next billing cycle.
13. Lost, Stolen, or Unauthorized Use of Your Card. You agree to notify us immediately, orally or in writing, of
the loss, theft, or unauthorized use of your Card. We may investigate any cases of unauthorized use of your Card.
We may terminate or limit access to your Card if you have notified us or we have determined that your Card or
convenience checks may have been lost or stolen, or that there may be unauthorized access to your Card. Unless
you have been negligent or have engaged in fraud, you will not be liable for any unauthorized transactions using
your lost or stolen Card. If you are liable for unauthorized transactions, your liability will not exceed $50. You will
not be liable for unauthorized transactions that occur after you notify us at:
BECU, P.O. Box 97050,
Seattle, WA 98124-9750
Telephone:
206-439-5700 or outside Seattle at 800-233-2328
Hours:
7:00 a.m. - 7:00 p.m. PT Monday-Friday
and 9:00 a.m. - 1:00 p.m. PT Saturday.
After hours only for use of reporting the loss, theft, or unauthorized use of your Card:
Call 800-449-7728
14. Additional Provisions
a. Visa Account Updater. BECU may use the Visa Account Updater (VAU) service, which would automatically
update your card-on-file information at participating merchants, for example sending updates about replacement
account numbers if your card is lost or stolen. BECU reserves the right to terminate or suspend, or reinstate,
the functioning of the VAU service for one or more individual Visa accounts or for all Visa accounts, in BECU’s
discretion at any time, and without prior notice. If you have questions about the VAU service or would like to
opt out of this service, please call one of the phone numbers listed in Section 13 above, or write to the address
stated there. Opt-outs are completed within 5-7 business days after request.
12
b. Recurring Merchant Transactions. If you authorize a merchant to charge your account for repeat
transactions with your Card, you must notify the merchant when you want to discontinue the repeat
transactions, including when your Card account is closed or a new Card number is issued by us, and you must
monitor your periodic statements to be vigilant for unauthorized recurring transactions with merchants who
participate in the VAU service described above. You may opt out of the VAU service to block all participating
merchants from receiving your updated account information.
c. Ownership of Cards. Any Card is our property and must be returned to us or our agent, immediately upon
demand. If we ask, you will destroy the Card by cutting it in half and will surrender it to us or our agent, mail it to
us, or take it to a location we designate.
d. Honoring of Card. We will not be responsible for the failure or refusal of anyone to honor the Card. Although
your New Balance may be less than your credit limit, we may fail or decline to authorize a particular transaction
due to the failure of a communications or computer system, due to other operational difficulties or due to issues
particular to your account, including your default of any agreement with us, an adverse change in your financial
situation, an amendment or termination of your participation in the Plan or, at our discretion, other reasons that
we deem to be appropriate.
e. Transfer of Card. You cannot transfer your Card to any other person, although you will be liable for any use
by anyone else that has been authorized by you or another Cardholder.
f. Transactions with Internet Merchants. In order to make transactions over the internet, merchants may
request your Verified by Visa password to complete the transaction. If a password is not provided, the merchant
may deny the transaction. If the password is incorrect, we may deny the transaction.
g. Merchant Return Policy. If a merchant discloses a policy such as “no returns,” “no refund”, “no return or
credit without receipt”, “as is”, “store credit only”, or “all sales final”, you will be bound by that policy when you
use your Card to buy goods or services from that merchant.
h. Merchant Refunds. If a seller agrees to give you a refund or adjustment, you will accept a credit to your
Card in lieu of a cash refund.
i. Merchant Reservations. When using your account to make travel or lodging reservations, obtain the
merchant’s cancellation policy and follow it if you cancel. If you cancel, obtain the merchant’s cancellation
number that it is required to give you. The merchant may charge you for a canceled transaction unless you can
provide us with the merchant’s cancellation number.
j. Merchant Dispute Assistance. If you disagree with a transaction on your statement or have a dispute with
the merchant as a result of the transaction, you will provide information or assistance we reasonably request
to permit us to investigate the transaction. Otherwise, you will pay us for any resulting loss we have (up to the
amount of the transaction) unless we are prohibited by applicable law from holding you liable for our loss. If any
provision of this paragraph conflicts with any part of the “Your Billing Rights” disclosure below that is applicable
to the particular transaction, the terms of the “Your Billing Rights” disclosure will control.
k. Transactions. For statement verification, you will retain your copy of each receipt (ticket/draft) resulting
from each Purchase, Cash Advance, or other transaction on your Card. We will provide you with documentary
evidence of each transaction upon your reasonable request or upon proper written notice of a billing error. (See
Section 8.e of this Part C for cost information.)
l. Phone Inquiries. Inquiries regarding your Card may be made by calling BECU at 206- 439-5700 or, outside
Seattle at 800-233-2328 or by writing us at the address provided below.
m. Our Address. Please address all other correspondence, letters and notices (excluding payments) with
respect to Cards to us at: BECU P.O. Box 97050, Seattle, WA 98124 or Customer Service P.O. Box 31112
Tampa, Florida 33631-3112.
n. Inactivity. BECU reserves the right to terminate the credit if there are no transactions in one year.
o. Non-Activation. If the Cardholder fails to activate the Card within 30 calendar days after the card is sent to
the Cardholder, BECU reserves the right to cancel your account.
p. Closing your Account. You can cancel or close your account by either calling us at 206- 439-5700 or, outside
Seattle at 800-233- 2328 or writing us at the address provided above. If you cancel the Account, you must pay
everything you owe us, including any amounts owed but not yet billed to you. If you do not pay us immediately,
outstanding balances will continue to accrue finance charges and other fees or charges, and be subject to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement. You also agree to return to us or destroy your Card(s) and any unused
Convenience Checks. You agree that you will not attempt to make a Purchase or Cash Advance after you have been
notified of your or our termination or suspension of your credit privileges. You further understand and agree that it is
13
your sole responsibility to terminate your authorization of all reoccurring transactions you may have scheduled with
merchants or other third parties.
15.BECU REWARDS PROGRAM OPTION.
You may elect to add a BECU rewards program (“Program”) to your Card account. Upon enrolling in a Program,
you agree to accept the terms, conditions and rules for the Program that are in addition to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement and which otherwise govern your Card. The terms, conditions and rules for the
Program become effective immediately upon our receipt and acknowledgment of your instructions to enroll you in
the Program, and will apply only to the purchases of goods and services made with your Card after that effective
date. If you were already a cardholder before you enrolled and your enrollment results in an increase in the
margin applicable to your account, then BECU will send you a notice showing the increased margin and
corresponding increased Annual Percentage Rate and the effective date of such changes.
II.YOUR BILLING RIGHTS
Your Billing Rights: Keep this Document for Future Use
This notice tells you about your rights and our responsibilities under the Fair Credit Billing Act.
What To Do If You Find a Mistake on Your Statement
If you think there is an error on your credit card statement, write to us at either:
BECU
P.O. Box 97050
Seattle, WA 98124
Customer Service
P.O. Box 31112
Tampa, FL 33631-3112
If you think there is an error on your personal line of credit statement, write to us at:
Research and Adjustments
P.O. Box 97050
Seattle, WA 98124-97050
In your letter, give us the following information:
•Account information: Your name and account number.
•Dollar amount: The dollar amount of the suspected error.
•Description of problem: If you think there is an error on your bill, describe what you believe is wrong and why
you believe it is a mistake.
You must contact us:
•Within 60 days after the error appeared on your statement.
•At least 3 business days before an automated payment is scheduled if you want to stop payment on the
amount you think is wrong.
You must notify us of any potential errors in writing. You may call us, but if you do we are not required to
investigate any potential errors and you may have to pay the amount in question.
What Will Happen After We Receive Your Letter
When we receive your letter, we must do two things:
1.Within 30 days of receiving your letter, we must tell you that we received your letter. We will also tell you if we
have already corrected the error.
2.Within 90 days of receiving your letter, we must either correct the error or explain to you why we believe the
bill is correct.
While we investigate whether or not there has been an error:
•We cannot try to collect the amount in question, or report you as delinquent on that amount.
14
•The charge in question may remain on your statement, and we may continue to charge you interest on that
amount.
•While you do not have to pay the amount in question, you are responsible for the remainder of your balance.
•We can apply any unpaid amount against your credit limit.
After we finish our investigation, one of two things will happen:
•If we made a mistake: You will not have to pay the amount in question or any interest or other fees related to
that amount.
•If we do not believe there was a mistake: You will have to pay the amount in question, along with applicable
interest and fees. We will send you a statement of the amount you owe and the date payment is due. We may
then report you as delinquent if you do not pay the amount we think you owe. If you receive our explanation but
still believe your bill is wrong, you must write to us within 10 days telling us that you still refuse to pay. If you do
so, we cannot report you as delinquent without also reporting that you are questioning your bill. We must tell
you the name of anyone to whom we reported you as delinquent, and we must let those organizations know
when the matter has been settled between us. If we do not follow all of the rules above, you do not have to pay
the first $50 of the amount you question even if your bill is correct.
Your Rights If You Are Dissatisfied With Your Credit Card Purchases
If you are dissatisfied with the goods or services that you have purchased with your credit card, and you have
tried in good faith to correct the problem with the merchant, you may have the right not to pay the remaining
amount due on the purchase.
To use this right, all of the following must be true:
1.The purchase must have been made in your home state or within 100 miles of your current mailing address,
and the purchase price must have been more than $50.
(Note: Neither of these are necessary if your purchase was based on an advertisement we mailed to you, or if
we own the company that sold you the goods or services.)
2.You must have used your credit card for the purchase. Purchases made with cash advances from an ATM or with
a check that accesses your credit card account do not qualify.
3.You must not yet have fully paid for the purchase.
If all of the criteria above are met and you are still dissatisfied with the purchase, contact us in writing at:
Customer Service
P.O. Box 31112
Tampa, FL 33631-3112.
While we investigate, the same rules apply to the disputed amount as discussed above. After we finish our
investigation, we will tell you our decision. At that point, if we think you owe an amount and you do not pay, we
may report you as delinquent.

Restriction of Services
Navy Federal may restrict or suspend access by a Member to any or all products or services,
except the basic rights of a Member to vote in annual and special meetings and maintain a share

This conduct includes, but is not limited to, actions that abuse the products or services of the
credit union; abusive or threatening behavior; and suspicious, fraudulent, illegal, dishonest,
or deceptive activities. Restrictions or suspensions of accounts, products, and/or services will
be reasonably related to the nature of the Member’s conduct. This policy will also apply to joint
owners and authorized users of accounts, products, and services. When a Member is delinquent
on a loan or has caused Navy Federal a loss, Navy Federal may deny that Member’s subsequent
application for any new product or service that would allow the Member to obtain further credit from
Navy Federal or cause Navy Federal a further loss. Pursuant to Navy Federal’s bylaws and the Federal
Credit Union Act, Members may be expelled at a special meeting called for the purpose of expelling
those Members.
