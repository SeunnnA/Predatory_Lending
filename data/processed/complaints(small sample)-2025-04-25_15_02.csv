03/22/23,"Payday loan, title loan, or personal loan",Installment loan,Charged fees or interest you didn't expect,None,"This company 's offer was not clear. 

This account was opened in XX/XX/XXXX through a tire purchasing service. There was an offer to help build credit and finance for a tire purchase. The tire purchase totalled {$1000.00} with an early payoff period of 100 days. I was granted a standard credit limit of {$2000.00}. What they did not relay was they would charge a 200 % "" leasing fee '' at the time of the purchase. It was relayed that it would be standard percentage finance fees up to 34 %. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I contacted to inquire why the balance was so high with such a significant amount being paid off. The total amount paid on the account as of XX/XX/XXXX is {$1400.00}. That's {$420.00} over the amount originally financed. 

The representative claimed that there was a "" leasing fee '' of {$1900.00} on the account. They claim after the 100 day period they would discount the leasing fee by 55 % but capped my account discount at {$560.00} which is less than the 55 %. Then charged an additional sales tax of 6 % on top of the tires that was already charges sales tax for the total amount and the "" leasing fee. '' The account has had a total amount paid {$1400.00}. When I called to figure out why the account has a balance of {$1100.00} when the total amount paid is far exceeding the total amount financed, it's this now called "" leasing fee. '' When I said this was not explained that the rate at which we took for the purchase was a percentage like a standard loan was converted to a 200 % leasing fee. 

I did my research and I went ahead and took a look at the process with another individual and the business does not describe there is a 200 % lease fee, it shows as a standard purchasing loan process with a percentage of up to 34 % not 200 %. No one in their right mind would agree to a 200 % fee of what they were purchasing especially in an economy like we have. 

This is unethical practices in every capacity. It is misleading. I would not do business with this company again nor recommend anyone else do business with them. It is a requirement to fully disclose all fees, expenses associated with a loan of any kind.

In XXXX of XXXX  my balance was {$1400.00}. The fees and biking charges are {$85.00} each bi-weekly period. According to the Truth in Lending act there needs to be a break down on the statement of the amount of interest you are charging. I see in the farms and conditions I am signing say billing cycle charge can not be waived. Credit Fresh is in violation of the Truth in Lending act by not having a proper break down of the total number of payments. The withdraws dont even show a date on the statement, annuals percentage rate, and security interest disclosures.

Credit fresh is using aggressive tactics and unfair loan termssuch as high interest rates and feesto take advantage of unsuspecting borrowers. Credit Fresh is going after the most vulnerable and least knowledgeable borrowers Regulation Z is a Federal Reserve Board rule that requires lenders to give you the true cost of credit in writing before you borrow. That includes spelling out the amount of money loaned, the interest rate, APR, finance charges, fees and length of loan terms. An unlawful loan may also be some form of credit or loan that disguises its true cost or fails to disclose relevant terms regarding the debt or information about the lender. This sort of loan is in violation of the Truth in Lending Act ( TILA ).

My complaint is that it is taking advantage of me if my new credit balance is {$1500.00}. My booking charges in two months amount of two {$420.00} and the credit amount to my actual balance is {$98.00}.

01/10/23,"Payday loan, title loan, or personal loan",Personal line of credit,Getting a line of credit,None,"ood afternoon! I must say I am very frustrated with THESE COMPANIES. I have been trying to get a loan with THEM for years. Even when I had a XXXX to XXXX XXXX XXXX, I could never get loans with you. I have been wondering for many years that maybe it's just me and maybe it's my credit. I have been going years and years with disputing things off my credit and getting my credit as high as ever. I have done everything to try to make my credit manageable, and I have still BEEN turned down for a loan every time. So now we are gon na do things my way! Let me inform your company of some Laws protecting consumers. XXXX cfr part XXXX talks about the Equal Credit Opportunity Act. Consumers by law can not be denied credit. By law you all can not deny me credit transactions for any applications. Please see the screenshots below I am a CREDIT WORTHY APPLICANT. Individual accounts can not by law deny me credit. This is DISCRIMINATION. I have many adverse action letters even from when my credit was even in the mid XXXX and I was still getting denied. So it makes me think who is responsible for this, the credit bureaus or your company.. Please refer to the other screenshot below. Adverse actions are illegal amongst consumers. Adverse action : ( ii ) does not include ( I ) information solely as to "" transactions '' or experiences between the consumer and the person furnishing the information; or ( II ) information in a consumer report. These are transactions that I have applied for for years and I was turned down everytime. This is {$1000.00} per violation if I pursued this towards court. This is 15 u.s. 1681m. Please view that as your company has broken this law and has resulted in me being denied for credit over and over. My SSN is my credit card which has been unauthorized by your company, bureaus etc. So you all can make money off my ssn but I can't benefit from credit transactions which are illegal!! Loans, Mortgage, car notes etc are extensions of credit transactions! There is civil liability for violation of these laws! Please see 15 usc XXXX. I posted the screenshot below I have been denied credit from you for years and I refuse to be denied again. Please forward this to your manager or corporate and have them contact me immediately! I want a loan of {$50000.00} or higher. I deserve that amount for all the years of frustration your company has caused me!!! I also want to get some credit cards to improve my credit asap! Please don't make me go to higher authorities and take you to court like I may soon do with the credit bureaus. If I take you to court, I have consumer rights attorneys waiting for a case like this.

If you value your money, credit score, and time get a loan offer through XXXX online or another reputable company. The people ( especially the manager at XXXX XXXX branch in XXXX, AL ) running the Tower Loan locations are rude, unprofessional, uncaring, liars, power hungry, deceitful, and opportunistic. It's a never ending saga with Tower Loans even after my loan was paid in full in less than 90 days. The manager at the XXXX XXXX location in XXXX, AL reported to the credit report that I borrowed {$8000.00} but I only borrowed {$2500.00}. He, also, wanted me to put my car ; which is paid in full, up for collateral and I've never had to do that before. Because of the above reasons and more, I decided to take my business elsewhere... specifically, XXXX, XXXX XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX. It, then, turned ugly at Tower Loans. There is a reason that Tower Loan has a D- score with the XXXX XXXX XXXX and isn't accredited at the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX There is, also, a reason why the Tower Loan at XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, AL has a XXXX score locally. Tower loan corporate office response to my review on the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX wasn't know objective but subjective and they weren't there... and as if I'm not telling the truth. Tower Loans main website may say that it has a XXXX score ; but that hasn't been my experience and apparently many others. All the reviewers can't be lying. Maybe someone from corporate should visit to find out why or is it the culture at Tower Loan to try to take advantage of people when you think they are vulnerable, have fallen upon hard times, and during the holiday season? Of course, corporate would say that it's not documented that I inquired about the pay-off and my credit report... they work for Tower Loans, and really that's another negative reflection on their company. Documentation is important to good customer service. Numerous times over the short period I had an account with Tower Loans, the employees tried to push another loan upon me and wondered why I declined. As it neared XXXX, I told them I'll look into it and applied online. If they had told me up front that I had to put my car up as collateral, I would have declined without a hit to my credit report. I told the employees, and I overheard them tell the manager several times that I have never had to use my car as collateral. While 1 or 2 days passed, I asked to speak with the manager, but he would never come to the phone. He continued to have employees relay messages to me and insisted that I put my car up for collateral and they even stated that they would get the title from the XXXX for me. I took my business elsewhere. As I applied at another company, the representative stated that my credit report shows that I had just opened a loan account with Tower Loan in the amount of {$8000.00}. I called the XXXX XXXX location and told them what happened and asked how long it will take to remove it. As usual, the employees relayed a message from the manager whom I could hear sometimes rudely exclaiming his response in the background. I had to call 2 or 3 times to get that fixed. The manager at the XXXX XXXX location in XXXX, AL and other employees didn't want to take my final payment of about {$2100.00}. I had to call about 4 times and they charged me maybe {$200.00} more than I owed. The manager at the XXXX XXXX location in XXXX, AL is playing games and won't update my credit report account to reflect paid on time x 3 months, and paid in full. I filed a dispute with the credit bureaus and Tower Loans still haven't updated my credit report... it still states that I owe Tower Loans about {$2100.00}, it doesn't show months paid on time, and the account is still open and active. Even though the Tower Loans manager was trying to negatively effect my credit report, I was still approved for a new credit card through XXXX, a loan for more than 2 times, and a loan for 7 times what Tower Loans tried to offer me and I didn't have to put my car up for collateral and the interest rate is less than half of what the manager at Tower Loans at the XXXX XXXX location in XXXX, AL wanted to charge me. As far as my credit report is concerned, my Tower Loan account, lacks information and isn't accurate. I thought going to a small town and local business would be best but Tower Loans proved me wrong. I have information to support this statement, but for security purposes, it's not included. If Tower Loans headquarters want the information, I'll gladly provide it.

The first loan was a ok process and they offered me what I thought it was a good deal since I was looking to get a positive line of credit to start rebuilding my credit to possibly get it off the ground and a opportunity to save some capital. Moneylion presents itself as a lender that helps clients get ahead with a low risk collateral loan. Moneylion both times loaned me {$1000.00} once in XX/XX/XXXX and {$1000.00} XX/XX/XXXX. Moneylion on the first loan gave me appx {$600.00} of that {$1000.00} in XXXX and I made the payments on time but Moneylion brought in other fees such as Membership fees that were {$20.00} nearly and credit monitoring fee was {$5.00}.

I was made aware of this after a military training event when I made a check into my credit score. The company had performed little to no background checks in regards to ID verification, and had issued the loan with incorrect information. I had attempted to follow what the company had suggested according to their fraud department, and had contacted all three credit bureaus upon noticing the fraud account. Contact was made in XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX 

As with life in the service, I was not available to make follow ups on my own behalf in timely manners, and as such had my durable POA act on my behalf. To which the company refused to work with at every turn. Even after having been given complete access to the issue by my verbal omission. This has only extended the issue into this date of XXXX. 

As of XXXX where the company now claims to have failed to receive a forum provided by them that was submitted in triplicate to them, to the address that was provided by Upstart. A request on where to find a new forum to be faxed was made, where Upstart then provided incorrect information, and a fax number on where to send it once completed. Attempts to get the correct information failed, and the company has little to no interest it seems in getting the issue resolved. 

As a large overview of the situation, I have never had the displeasure of dealing with a company who is so unwilling to work with a fraud situation. I am in great disapproval at their customer care in regards to dealings with a POA, and their validation process to get a loan issued. As it seems there is little to no verification as to the correct ID of any information of the person.

The were sent to my bank on XX/XX/2023. My bank received the funds, however the account number was incorrect. The funds were then sent back to UPSTART on XX/XX/2023. 

On XX/XX/2023 I started calling and emailing to UPSTART to check on the funds. I was sent to several different people each time I called, and each call took a long time, most just under an hour. 
I was advised it still showed the loan funded, I emphasized the funds were not in my account. I was told once they ( upstart ) received the funds back I would be contacted to reenter my bank information. And the funds would be sent back to the correct bank account.

On XX/XX/2023, I went to my local branch of my bank. The representative at my bank verified the funds were sent back to UPSTART on XX/XX/2023.

Again I was advised an investigated would have to be done to verify they funds were sent back to the. 

This went on and on for days, several phone calls and emails. Finally on Friday XX/XX/2023, I spoke to a person that actually new what to do, she stayed on the phone with me I re entered my bank account information, she verified the account while I was on the line with her. I was then told my bank account was verified & the funds would be sent back to my bank the first of the week. I called on Monday XX/XX/2023 late afternoon, as the funds still did not show they were sent to my bank. Again holding for just under an hour, the staff member advised me the funds will be in my account by the end of the week, Friday XX/XX/2023.

I then called UPSTART, to find out what happened. I was told the loan did not fund in time from the original date. Evidently, when I finally had the account verified again on XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX, it was too late but none knew this. I was very upset. 

I was then advised I could reapply immediately. I did, & was advised I now do not qualify. I do not understand as I just was approved less than 10 days ago. I was devastated. Thinking the funds in the amount of {$1800.00} was to be in my account & now will not happen.

In a period of financial hardship, I was coerced into taking out a title loan with InstaLoan to pay off an amount of {$2500.00} within 30 days. The terms were designed to exploit vulnerable borrowers, imposing an exorbitant {$300.00} reactivation fee every month if it can not be paid in full, rendering it virtually impossible to repay the loan on time. 

As fate would have it, I was unable to meet the stringent repayment schedule, leading to the repossession of my vehicle. But the anguish did not end there ; upon the repossession, InstaLoans tow service, who had possession of my vehicle for less than XXXX XXXX, took it upon themselves to clear it of my belongings. I recently became homeless so there were many things of value inside of it. It included work tools that have disappeared, {$300.00} sunglasses that I never received and keepsakes from my wife who passed away exactly a year prior. They gave me no time to come there and remove my belongings. 

Of utmost heartbreak is the loss of irreplaceable keepsakes that once belonged to my beloved wife, who XXXX XXXX XXXX. These cherished items held immense sentimental value and were an irreplaceable connection to her memory. It is nothing short of devastating to know that they have been carelessly destroyed, tossed into big black garbage bags without any regard for their significance. 

Furthermore, InstaLoan violated my rights by disposing of my personal property without proper notification or a reasonable opportunity to retrieve my belongings. I reached out within XXXX hours of the repossession, only to be met with the agonizing revelation that my keepsakes were already in black garbage bags. 

I implore the CFPB to investigate the predatory lending practices employed by InstaLoan, which led to my financial distress and the loss of my treasured belongings. This distressing experience has left an indelible impact on my emotional well-being, amplifying the grief of losing my wife and causing further hardship. 

I earnestly seek justice and restitution for the wrongful actions of InstaLoan, urging the CFPB to take decisive action to prevent such predatory practices from harming other vulnerable individuals in the future. 

Please, help bring attention to this disheartening situation and hold InstaLoan accountable for their egregious actions, ensuring that no one else has to endure such emotional suffering and property loss in the pursuit of fair treatment and justice. I am considering legal action as well.

My complaint is that OMF is engaging in predatory lending by : 1 ) encouraging use of their application to make payments and then "" hiding '' the payment breakouts ( screenshot of the payment screen included ) 2 ) Not providing immediate full accounting of payment related activities by way of an emailed, and/or mailed receipt 3 ) Providing inaccurate information ( agent promised adjustment and corporate denied ), then not following up with the customer by call and email 4 ) refusing to furnish the detail of conversations about customers own account - the agents begin each conversation with the announcement that the call is being recorded.

The chosen method of accounting for an overpayment is to the advantage of OMF and not the consumer. The consumer should be made aware of what their options are at the time of payment, and/or the over amount should default to decrease the principal balance ( thereby decreasing the overall interest due ).

OneMain Financial violated the Uniform Commercial Code ( UCC ) by not returning remittance coupons, which they claimed they did not process or know how to process. Additionally, OneMain Financial is guilty of usury in violation of Georgia code. 

I spoke with XXXX XXXX in the repossession department who failed to send proper notice, which resulted in the illegal repossession of my vehicle. OneMain Financial did not provide me with any information about my right to redeem the vehicle or the fees associated with the redemption process, which resulted in an inaccurate redemption amount. Furthermore, OneMain Financial failed to state the intended method of disposition, and as a result, I was not able to make an informed decision about the redemption process. 

OneMain Financial 's actions were unfair and deceptive and have caused me significant harm. I am demanding that my vehicle be returned to me immediately. If my vehicle is not returned by XX/XX/2023, I will be forced to file a class-action lawsuit against OneMain Financial for engaging in illegal and unethical practices. 

Furthermore, I want to bring to your attention that OneMain Financial is guilty of usury, a violation of Georgia XXXX. They charged me an exorbitant amount of interest on my loan, which is illegal under Georgia law. 

I am requesting that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) investigate OneMain Financial 's practices and take appropriate action to prevent them from engaging in these types of unfair and deceptive practices in the future.

I cashed the check & in doing so I agreed to pay the money back as a loan in monthly installments. On the back of the check ( in fine print ) it clearly states no insurance policys could be added to this loan. ( I still have the check as proof ). 
This was not my first encounter with Tower Loan mailing me checks. In the past I had accepted & cashed checks sent from them. I always paid on time & in full until the loans were satisfied. 
But this time was different. Before my first payment was due Tower Loan called stating I was approved for {$500.00} more. She said, Just stop by & sign for it & they'll just add it to the original loan. I didnt think much of it. I went up there- & signed for the additional {$500.00}. 
I failed to realize what actually transpired that day. Actually it was many months later before I realized what they had done! First of all, they lied & produced a receipt which stated I paid off the original {$1200.00} loan in full- although I had not made the first payment yet! 
Instead of adding {$500.00} to my original {$1200.00} loan like we agreed -they completely rewrote the loan. Unbeknown to me they added {$180.00} Accidental Death & Dismemberment Insurance, {$120.00} Credit Life Insurance, {$130.00} Credit Disability Insurance, and {$230.00} Credit Property Insurance. Remember the check I cashed stated no insurance could be added to this loan. The insurance papers do NOT have my signature on them because I would NEVER in a million years pay for all that insurance on this little loan. Thats insane! Who would ever agree to pay an extra {$680.00} in insurance on a {$1200.00} loan? Dismemberment Insurance? Are you serious? They added insurance stating the loan would be paid even if my arm or leg got cut off? Well theyve definitely charged an arm & a leg!

I contacted Moneylion and i requested they update my payment since the Bank confirmed they already made the payment for {$94.00} and the monthly membership fee of {$19.00}. Yet Moneylion refused to update the accout and left my account showing PAST DUE for 10 days even thought they had already been paid. I find out that Moneylion was trying to process the payment the day before which is NOT a date i get paid on. They're suppose to have your payment processed the day it's due NOT the day before. I then changed my payment due date to the 3rd of the month so this wouldn't happen again. I was told by several agents this wouldn't happen again.

I included a picture for this as well. At midnight on XX/XX/XXXX i checked my Moneylion XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX account.

Moneylion blatantly lied on their app claiming once you pay off your loan they would send your funds to the bank account of your choice. Their chat agent stated a different story.

04/24/23,"Payday loan, title loan, or personal loan",Installment loan,Getting the loan,None,"This is a complaint that is being filed against GreenSky , LLC ( NMLS # XXXX ) aka XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX 

I submitted a loan application together with my wife ( XXXX XXXX ) who is trying to establish her credit as she just came to the U.S. last year. We were verbally declined by GreenSky. On the same date I resubmitted a separate loan application on my own name and was declined by GreenSky. We feel that we were discriminated and do not understand why we were declined with GreenSky but approved by another lender ( XXXX ) on the same day at a higher interest rate and loan payment. Further, when I called GreenSky to understand the specific reasons why I had been declined, no one could tell me specifically why I was declined credit. We also feel that we were caught in a bait and switch scheme. 

Facts : I submitted a joint loan application with my wife to GreenSky on XX/XX/XXXX. We applied for a {$25000.00} loan with GreenSky to finance the acquisition of a new energy efficient air conditioning unit. The XXXX who was to install the unit XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX personally took my application face-to-face and submitted it online to GreenSky on my behalf. XXXX XXXX told us that we were declined by GreenSky. When I ask the XXXX XXXX representative why we were declined, he was unable to tell us. He suggested to submit a new loan application under my own name and so we did. I was decline and again I was not given any specific reason ( s ) as to why I was declinedXXXX XXXX XXXX suggested that we submit my loan application to another lender ( XXXX ). I was hesitant as they had a higher interest rate, loan payment and term but agreed as I had no choice. My family was in potential danger since XXXX XXXX  had determined that the furnace on my A/C unit was cracked and could potentially rupture and start emitting carbon monoxide throughout my house. I was approved with XXXX at an 8.99 % APR, for {$25000.00} for 12 years. GreenSky was offering 5.99 % APR for {$25000.00} amortized over 10 years. 

On XX/XX/XXXX or thereabouts I received a declined letter from GreenSky. 
On XX/XX/XXXX I called GreenSky at XXXX, the phone number on their declined letter. I talked to someone by the name of XXXX who did not have access to my application and was helpless. She insisted that I needed to call XXXX and said they would explain why I was declined. I told her their denial letter specifically stated the following : The reporting agency played no part in our decision and is unable to supply specific reasons why we have denied credit to you. You also have the right to a free She apologized and said she was unable to help me. When I asked for their address where I could send her company a complaint, she said she did not have one and kept insisting that I contact XXXX. After I insisted and insisted and kept insisting that XXXX would not assist as they had not declined me for credit, she asked me for my date of birth and SS #. She then said that someone by the name of XXXX would assist me. When XXXX got online, I asked her title and she said she was a front-line manager. I told her my story and told her that I wanted to know specifically why I was denied because the reasons for denial on their letter were not reasons for denial under the law ( GreenSky reasons for denial were : 1. Number of recent inquiries on credit bureau report.

2. Unable to verify applicants identity.

3. Unable to verify application information ). 

She then told me that the reason I was declined was because my SS # was incorrect, I said how could it be incorrect when you pulled a credit report on me? And, if it was incorrect, then why did you not ask for the correct SS #. ( Subsequent to my call I requested a copy of my credit report from XXXX. Page 13 of the report shows a hard inquiry from GreenSky Installment ). 
She then said that I could re-apply. I said fine. I supposedly got transferred to sales, but instead, I was disconnected ( on purpose it seems to me ). 
I called back again and ended up talking to a customer service representative, someone by the name of XXXX. I told him my story and said that I wanted to file a complaint and he said he would open one a compliance resolution issue. 
On XX/XX/XXXX, someone by the name of XXXX from their customer service department called and said that she would open a compliance solutions case ( # XXXX ) and would notate that the reason of the complaint was an explanation for the reasons of credit denial. I asked her phone number and she gave me XXXX, x XXXX. She said someone from GreenSky would call me back. 
On XX/XX/XXXX XXXX called me back on a recorded line. She apologized and said could not see the reason why I was declined and could not offer any other information. she also mentioned that she could not resubmit my application because it was past 30 days from XX/XX/XXXX. I then asked, if you can not offer help then what is the purpose of your call? She said that it was because a complaint case was opened, and she had to follow up on the case as part of their protocol. 

Conclusion : I believe that under ECOA and Fair Lending laws, Im entitled to know the reasons why I was specifically declined.

I feel that the denial reasons on GreenSkys denial letter are not reasons for denial. As a result of their denial, I ended up with a loan with a much higher interest rate, payment and loan term and feel that this is not fair. Based on my excellent payment history ( XXXX XXXX ), income and assets to support the loan, how can the same applicant with the same credit profile, assets and income can be approved for a {$25000.00} loan at 8.99 % APR, for 12 years, but declined for the same loan amount with a much lower rate and payment ( 5.99 % APR for {$25000.00} amortized over 10 years ).

When I got my statement in XXXX from Citizen Pay I realized I was double charged for equipment so I called them to inquire and was told I needed to call XXXX since they were the ones that I purchased the equipment from. I called XXXX and spoke to them and explained the situation they did see the error that was made and informed me that they would send a request to Citizen to refund the money since I only got one item from them and not two. I waited until XX/XX/XXXX to get my statement to see if the billing issue had been fixed with Citizen. It showed where XXXX sent in the request of giving back the credit for the additional amount but Citizen was still charging me the equipment I did not have. I called Citizen that same month to inquire again and they give me the same story that I had to call XXXX so I again called XXXX and they explained we have already sent over the refund to Citizen and I explained that they are still billing me for equipment I did not have. This time XXXX did a three-way call with me and someone in the billing department at Citizen to resolve the issue. So Citizen informed me that the issue would be resolved by the next statement but it was not because when I got my statement in XXXX it was the same issue again. I was still being charged for the same issue as previously stated. I called Citizen Pay and they gave me same story that they did not see a refund sent back to them from XXXX. This went on all way until XX/XX/XXXX trying to get this issue resolved. When I got my statement in XX/XX/XXXX I see they finally corrected the issue but I never got a call or anything telling me the issue had been resolved.

07/11/23,"Payday loan, title loan, or personal loan",Title loan,Problem with the payoff process at the end of the loan,None,"Dear Sir/Madam, I am writing to file a formal complaint against Sheffield Financial regarding a recent transaction and their negligent miscommunication and breach of duty of care. I kindly request your assistance in conducting an investigation into this matter and seeking a resolution that upholds consumer rights and protects against deceptive practices. 

I provide the following details related to my complaint : Background Information : Date of initial loan agreement with Sheffield Financial : XX/XX/XXXX Loan account number : XXXX Description of the transaction : I financed a motorcycle purchase through Sheffield Financial with the understanding that the loan would be paid in full upon receipt of an XXXX  transfer from the buyer. The buyer took possession of the motorcycle based on Sheffield Financials ' communication on XX/XX/XXXX that if I did not hear back from them by XX/XX/XXXX that the check had cleared and I was "" good to go '', I was informed by the bank that "" no news was good news '' and any reasonable person would have believed that they were telling me that I was safe to hand over the motorcycle to the buyer.

Timeline of Events : XX/XX/XXXX : Loan agreement signed with Sheffield Financial. 

XX/XX/XXXX : ACH transfer from the buyer was submitted and deposited. Sheffield Financial informed me directly on a recorded call that "" no news was good news '' and that I would only hear from them if the check bounces, and that if I did not hear from them by XX/XX/XXXX then that means the check most likely cleared. 

XX/XX/XXXX : Based on my recorded discussions with Sheffield Financial and information they provided to me, I handed over the motorcycle to the buyer thinking everything was ok. 

XX/XX/XXXX : I logged onto my Sheffield Financial account and saw that the check had seemingly bounced, no one from the bank contacted me at all to notify what had happened, I had to call them to understand. This was after them telling me on XX/XX/XXXX that "" no news was good news ''. The buyer committed fraud and neither sending or receiving bank has given me any information how they were both fooled by a scam artist that was either using fake or stolen information to submit a {$10000.00} ACH transfer to purchase this bike from me. There is an active investigation in process by the XXXX Police Department here in Florida. This is a case of Grand Theft Auto by Fraud and potential Identify Theft. Neither bank protected me, and my bank ( Sheffield Financial ) breached their duty of care and misled me into thinking I was ok to give the buyer the bike on XX/XX/XXXX. They have given me no indication as to what went wrong and instead are blaming me for giving the buyer the bike. Even the local police department admitted that the bank has to take some liability in this case, and they even advised me to sue Sheffield Financial in this instance. Sheffield Financial will not let me have any information from any of the recorded calls and are blaming the vicitim leaving me on the hook to pay back {$10000.00} for the remaining balance of the loan on a bike that was stolen. 

XX/XX/XXXX : Contacted by Sheffield Financial, stating that their internal investigation concluded that I am still responsible for the loan balance. They argued that they did not specifically tell me the check had cleared but instead said "" at this point the check has not bounced ''. Ignoring the fact that on XX/XX/XXXX they told me "" No news was good news '' and that I would only hear from them IF the check bounces, and that if I don't hear back by XX/XX/XXXX that means the check most likely cleared. They told me on a recorded call that it was safe to wait till that date to hand over the bike. They blamed me, took zero responsibility and have provided me with no information on what went wrong and how they and the sending bank were both fooled. 

I truly believe that this is a case of Negligent Misrepresentation and Breach of Duty of care. Any Reasonable Person would have taken what the bank told me and translated that as being safe to give the buyer the motorcycle on XX/XX/XXXX. 

Please let me know if any further information or documentation is required from my end to facilitate the investigation. I appreciate your attention to this matter and look forward to a prompt response.

XX/XX/XXXX : I Received a huge amount of interest charge on the credit card, saying that I have not paid in full within two years and therefore demanded a huge interest fee of {$3300.00} I checked the reason why I didn't finish the payment : 1. The credit card company changed my monthly payment into a minimum monthly payment of about {$130.00} without my authorization. 2. They added me to the card security plan without authorization. I did not agree on all of the changes and the company did not notice me at all! 
XX/XX/XXXX : I called them more than 10 times to ask why my monthly payment was changed and they charged me card security fee every month, with a total amount of {$2000.00}. They claimed it's a promotion, but what kind of promotion is this! I did not say yes to this neither did they notify me. This a scam and a fraud! 
XX/XX/XXXX : After arguing with them, they promised they will refund the entire card security fee, but they only refunded {$900.00}, not {$2000.00}. They still owe me {$1100.00}! 
XX/XX/XXXX : The credit card department told me that my due date is XXXX. If I can pay off the remaining money before then, all the interest ( the {$3300.00} they charged me ) will be refunded, but I told her that my remaining includes card security plan {$1100.00}. Credit card department suggested that I have to wait for the card security department to refund me before paying the remaining balance. 
XX/XX/XXXX : The card security department promised me to refund the money but still didnt refund it. As a result, I still couldnt pay off my credit card fee. They promised me that their supervisor would call me in one day. However, neither my husband nor I have received a message so far. I have returned to my own country on XX/XX/XXXX and told them please contact my husband, but there is still no updates. 

In conclusion, I should only need to pay {$1800.00} to credit card department, because from XXXX to now, according to my payment record from XXXX XXXX  I've already paid {$3800.00} ( Total surgery fee is {$5700.00} ).

07/28/23,"Payday loan, title loan, or personal loan",Installment loan,Problem with the payoff process at the end of the loan,None,"Subject : Concerns Regarding Retail Installment Contract as a Negotiable Instrument Dear Credit Acceptance, I am writing to address several concerns related to my retail installment contract, which operates as a negotiable instrument under our agreement. 

A negotiable instrument is a document guaranteeing payment of a specific amount of money, either on demand or at a set time, and can be transferred from one party to another. When XXXX sold this contract to Credit Acceptance, the contract effectively transformed into a negotiable instrument. This process of 'negotiating ' the contract allowed Credit Acceptance to become the new holder of this instrument. 

However, I have several concerns about potential violations of the XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX  ) and the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  ) in the processes and agreements related to this contract. 

Firstly, I believe there may have been a violation of UCC 1-201 ( 20 ), which requires full and accurate disclosure of contract terms. XXXX, as the original seller, did not provide complete and truthful disclosure of the contract and financial agreement terms. Furthermore, I was unduly coerced into paying a down payment under conditions not uniformly applied to other customers, potentially contravening XXXX XXXX that deals with unconscionable contracts. 

In regards to XXXX, its key purpose is to ensure the informed use of consumer credit by requiring disclosures about its terms and cost. If full disclosure was not provided, as appears to be the case, this could constitute a breach of XXXX. 

Moreover, I have experienced issues with Credit Acceptance, including coercive practices related to recurring payments and issues with the enforcement of the arbitration clause. My vehicle was repossessed from my private property without peaceable means, potentially breaching XXXX XXXX which outlines the secured party 's right to take possession after default. 

Concerningly, if Credit Acceptance is not licensed or registered in any U.S. state, it could potentially be in violation of state-specific financial regulations and licensing requirements, which vary from state to state. 

Considering these potential breaches and their impact on me, both financially and emotionally, I believe I am entitled to remediation under XXXX and XXXX regulations. 

I request a thorough investigation into these matters and expect appropriate remedies to be provided. I retain all rights under state and federal law to pursue this matter further if satisfactory resolution is not reached.

Additionally, customer service has failed to update my file to reflect my tax exemption status and remove my account out of an escrow status, whereas my property insurance is directly paid by me. On XX/XX/XXXX, Carrington Mortgage arbitrarily paid an annual premium to ( {$8.00}, XXXX ) to XXXX XXXX  from my Escrow Account ( depleting my escrow reserve ) without my consent, which in turn changed my homeowner insurance to a non-escrowed/directly billed account ).

Furthermore, Carrington mortgage is not paying my insurance premium monthly, whereas the annual premium has been paid thru XX/XX/XXXX, but Carrington Mortgage is still charging me monthly. 

Therefore, I am requesting the following remedies for my pain and suffering : 1.

Carrington Mortgage waive all late fees from XX/XX/XXXX through XX/XX/XXXXXXXX  and issue a credit to my account ; 3.

Instead money was kept by the Bank and Bank will not release it to us. 
Our property, a condominium in XXXX XXXX Florida, was effectively destroyed by XXXX XXXX in XX/XX/XXXX. Since then, I have been working to secure our insurance coverage funds so that we mXXXX repair it. We were issued a check by the insurance company for {$48000.00} in XX/XX/XXXX. The check required required endorsement by my wife and me and BBT ( now known as Truist Bank ) as the holder of our HELOC account ( line of credit ). 
I went through a very long and frustrating process to ascertain what I needed to do to get the check endorsed by Truist so I could use the funds to reconstruct the condo. I obtained all of the documentation and information required and sent it along with the unendorsed check in to the Truist address provided. The Bank sent back the check to me with a letter stating that my wife and I needed to endorse the check and resend. I visited our local XXXX Florida Branch Manager XXXX XXXX and the Sr Relationship Banker XXXX XXXX who stated that despite my expressed misgivings about sending in an endorsed check, that this was necessary for the Bank to endorse and return it to me to cash and/or for the Bank to deposit in our line of credit account. Based on the express representations of the Branch Manager and the Sr Relationship Banker, who are legal agents of the Bank, my wife and I endorsed the check in their presence and left it with them for deposit in our HELOC account or to send back to us with the Banks endorsement so we could use it. 
However, this did not occur. Instead, I learned on the afternoon of XX/XX/XXXX after many phone calls and emails that the check has been kept by the Bank and we can not access it. I was told that we will receive a small portion of it soon but the bulk only after we complete all of the repairs using our own money followed by inspection by the Bank and submission of verification documents. As I explained to XXXX XXXX of the Bank who apprised me of this, this is infeasible as it will require our expenditures of up to an estimated {$100000.00} which we would have to pay out of pocket without access to the insurance money. Because the Bank has taken our insurance money, we will have to front the payments which will require high interest loans and personal hardship. 
I am a retired partner from the XXXX firm. Based upon my practice representing banks I believe that Truist committed both civil and criminal violations by representing and promising that our endorsed check would be deposited in our account or returned to us with the Banks endorsement so that we could cash it but than, without telling us or providing any prior notice, keeping it and depriving us access to the funds. The Banks unauthorized and surreptitious action in depositing in its own account constitutes, among other things conversion, misrepresentation and fraud. 
To be clear, we gave the endorsed check to the Branch based on the express representations by the officials there that we would receive the money through our line of credit account or return of the check with endorsement by the bank. During our many conversations with the Bank trying to figure this out how to proceed, no one told us that by submitting our endorsed check, the bank would take it. While I understand, the Bank may have policies and procedures on insurance matters, it must advise the client of those policies.

Although enrolled, I follow a fortnightly payment schedule [ set months in advance ] that covers the minimum payment and then some. My due date is on the XXXX. 

In XXXX, I had payments scheduled for {$120.00} each on XXXX & XXXX, which covered the minimum payment of {$230.00}. These payments processed without issue. 

In XXXX, I had payments scheduled for {$120.00} each on XXXX and XXXX, which covered the minimum payment of {$230.00}. The XXXX payment processed with no issues, leaving a minimum payment due on the account in the ballpark of {$110.00}. On the XXXX, despite being aware of a payment being scheduled for {$120.00}, Prosper 's payment system proceeded to process both the previously scheduled {$120.00} payment and arbitrarily processed an additional full month 's payment of {$230.00}. 

Prosper 's payment system logic is not UDAAP compliant and exhibits systemic abusive behavior against consumers in the following respects : 1 ) the system is designed with no inherent consideration to a consumer 's already scheduled payment plan 2 ) the automatic payment system is advertised as meeting minimum monthly payments, however it deliberately ignores other payments made during the billing period ( see example below ) 3 ) the automatic payment system does not have consistent practices ( i.e. in XXXX back to back months XXXX and XXXX I had {$120.00} payments scheduled on XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX ; enough to satisfy the required payments for each billing period. There was no issue with an extra payment being processed in XXXX, whereas in XXXX Prosper decided to change their practices. 
4 ) Prosper 's loan origination process [ at least at the time of this loan ] pretty much forced enrollment into automatic payments [ you can see in my payment history I've managed my payments independently since account inception and this incident is the first time automatic payment has been utilized since the beginning.

This is in response to the statement that Acima does not identify as the original "" creditor '' or that "" consumer credit transactions '' does not apply to them. Well the credit was extended to me so someone has to the be the original creditor in this agreement. I am pointing out XXXX XXXX XXXX as as the original creditor for this Acima leasing agreement because of the signature I see signed from the original lease agreement through a XXXX representative. Also because of the notion that Acima is saying consumer credit transactions don't apply to them and they are not the original creditor. I am filing a complaint to both companies for failing to disclose in the original leasing agreement that the debt is in fact incurring from XXXX XXXX XXXX  and using false pretenses to hide the fact XXXX XXXX XXXX  is the original creditor in this leasing agreement under the Acima name. ADDITIONALLY, I'd like to defer the federal violations from the previous complaint to Acima to XXXX XXXX XXXX as they are identified as the original creditor of this lease agreement.

In the original leasing agreement with Acima Credit ( or XXXX XXXX XXXX, the company states that there is a loan processing fee of {$20.00} for processing and preparing documents for the lease. This is in direct violation of 15 U.S. Code 1605 ( e ) ( 2 ) which states that, items exempted from computation of finance charge in extensions of credit secured by an interest in real property SHALL NOT include fees for preparation of loan-related documents. The {$20.00} charge from Acima ( or XXXX XXXX XXXX ) is evidence of this violation. Moreover, 15 U.S. Code 1605 ( f ) ( 1 ) ( A ) states that credit transactions not under an open-ended credit plan secured by real property shall not be treated as accurate if the amount disclosed in the finance charge varies by more than {$100.00} of the original finance charge. The cost of payment in the original leasing agreement shows that this varies by more than {$100.00} from the cost of the amount of credit that was extended to purchase the real property. This also violates 15 U.S. Code 1605 ( f ) ( 2 ) ( A ) which states that the amount disclosed as the finance charge should not vary from the actual finance charge by more than an amount equal to one-half of XXXX percent of the total amount of credit extended.",None,"ACIMA CREDIT, LLC",CA,90621,None,Consent provided,Web,03/31/23,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,6781111

03/15/23,"Payday loan, title loan, or personal loan",Installment loan,Charged fees or interest you didn't expect,None,"On or about XX/XX/XXXX, I was approved for a personal loan with Upstart Financial in the amount of {$7700.00}. The repayment term was 60 months, interest rate of 25 %, a loan processing fee of 10 %, and a monthly payment of {$220.00}. To date, I have paid approximately {$2100.00} towards my personal loan. However, I was checking my balance online and my account states I owe {$7800.00}, more than my original loan amount of {$7700.00}. 

After reviewing all of my payments made over the past 14 months, Upstart Financial has not applied any of the payments towards my principal. I contacted Upstart and talked to a manager to find out what's going on with my account since none of the {$2100.00} in payments were applied towards any part of my principal balance and now I actually owe more than my original loan amount. 

The manager advised me that their company charges the financial charge each day at the rate of 25 %. I was never informed by Upstart that the finance charge was going to be assessed each day on my balance. This type of lending is criminal and predatory. California and Federal law prohibit daily and compound interest by any lender. 
Charging my account daily interest ( without my knowledge ) is in direct violation of the Consumer Protection Laws and TILA. In XXXX, Governor XXXX passed a law placing a cap on interest rates, excessive fees, and requiring interest calculations to only be calculated as simple interest annually. 

Lenders are prohibited from charging any interest during a deferment and during any grace period. Upstart has charged my account significant and unwarranted interest and fees during these periods on my account. For the record, my payment due date is the XXXX of the month. For example, my XXXX payment was due on XX/XX/XXXX, and I have a 15 day grace period. The payment was made on XX/XX/XXXX and the entire payment was paid towards interest. I have contacted your company several times to change my due date to the XXXX of the month. I work for the State of California and only get paid once a month on the XXXX. Your company clearly stated in writing that I can utilize the 15 day grace period and there would not be any type of penalty. However, this was a lie and every payment made after XX/XX/XXXX, has only been applied towards interest. This is prohibited under the laws and need to be corrected immediately. 

Payments are required to be posted the date received and the lender is forbidden from charging and additional fees or interest, after the date payment is received. I had two prior loans with Upstart that I paid off. The payoff cashier 's checks were sent to the over night address and Upstart held onto the payments for over 2 weeks, while charging daily interest on my account.",None,"Upstart Holdings, Inc.",CA,95841,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,03/15/23,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,6699875

We purchased furniture on the line of credit and were advised an annual fee of {$49.00} would be charged if we didn't cancel the financing after the purchase was paid off. 

We opted to keep it open just in case we wanted to finance additional purchases, but never used it. In XXXX, we received a bill for the expected {$49.00}. The terms indicate I could pay a minimum of {$30.00} and pay off the balance in XXXX months, but if I was late I could be charged up to {$41.00} in late fees. I mistakenly wrote the due date down wrong and did not pay it on XX/XX/XXXX as required. On XX/XX/XXXX I received a text message indicating the payment was late and a link to make the payment. When I went to the site, it didn't tell me the balance, only offered to pay via check or debit card. The charge was actually {$60.00}, not {$49.00} and there was no itemization. I assumed this meant my late fee was a reasonable {$11.00} and the balance was paid. This was because they took {$60.00}. 

Please Note : If Fortiva was taking the full late fee plus minimum payment, the charge would have been {$71.00} ; if they were taking the full balance plus the full late fee, the charge would have been {$90.00}. 

This morning, I received a call from Fortiva claiming I owed {$20.00} and could settle the full balance by phone. I explained this can not be correct because in no scenario would my balance be {$20.00}. It should be {$0.00}, but even if the {$60.00} had been the minimum payment of {$30.00} ( not paying in full as I thought ), that would have left me with a balance of {$19.00}, not {$20.00}. I proceeded to tell the man to cancel my line of credit. After the call I produced written requests to cancel to be sent to the correspondence and corporate offices.

Days later, I received my order from XXXX XXXX, but I noticed that some of the items were missing so, therefore, I decided to contact the merchant, XXXX XXXX to receive credit or get the items missing to be shipped to me again. XXXX XXXX, never issued a refund to my account, and the missing items were never delivered to my address. 

On XXXX XXXX, XXXX, I received a notification that my account with Citizens Pay was closed due to fraud and identity theft. I immediately contacted Citizens Pay, and a customer representative by the name of XXXX informed me that XXXX XXXX, had reported my account as fraudulent and he informed me that I should dispute this issue with them. I spend close to 45 minutes on the phone with XXXX XXXX and they informed me that Citizens XXXX had flagged my account for fraud and identity theft and that I should have contacted Citizens XXXX and not XXXX XXXX. 

After another XXXX minutes on the phone with the same representative from Citizens XXXX, XXXX, then informed me that I had to send an email to XXXX in order to get this matter investigated. I wish he would have informed me of this and not been so dismissive when assisting clients. Nonetheless, I inquired into the reason why my account was flagged for fraud or identity theft if I did not report it as so. A manager by the name of XXXX from Citizens XXXX, also instructed me that I should email them, and she did not know why my account was flagged for fraud. 

I never reported fraud on my account, nor did I file an identity theft on my account with Citizens XXXX. Thus, their erroneous information caused the credit line I had with Citizens XXXX to close and my credit score to drop as a result of their erroneous information. 

Please be aware that I did purchase the items from XXXX XXXX, my only dispute with them was that I was missing items from my original order and I was never given any credit for those missing items. In addition, Citizens XXXX incorrectly coded my account as fraud and their negligence caused my credit score to drop and for my credit report to contain false information which is a violation of the FCRA.

The offer was for a {$400.00} welcome bonus when you sign up for both the card and their checking account. They offer good interest rates, so I decided to sign up. 

POSSIBLY IMPORTANT- I saw the offer on the XXXX app, and clicked the link to apply through that app. 

After the initial application process, I thought it was odd that I wasn't prompted to open a checking account. It was after midnight at this point, so I decided to deal with it when I woke up in the morning. I signed up for a checking account later on XXXX, and added a savings account. I then called the bank to make sure I didn't miss anything with the application process. 

I was told by Upgrade customer service that I didn't qualify for a {$400.00} bonus, that my bonus offer was {$100.00} after I spent {$500.00} on the line of credit. They went on to tell me that the {$400.00} offer was through XXXX XXXX, and I should go to them with any further questions. 

I tried to contact XXXX XXXX that day through their online help form, and got no response. 

Today, XXXX, I looked at all the pages on Upgrade 's website, and found the {$400.00} signup offer- it was for a card, connected to a checking account, just like I originally tried to sign up for.

They told me that they couldn't make any changes, and that XXXX XXXX was responsible for the error, since I clicked a link through their website. 

I contacted XXXX XXXX through online chat, and was told, in essence, that they had nothing to do with affiliate links and couldn't correct anything on their end.

06/27/23,"Payday loan, title loan, or personal loan",Personal line of credit,Charged fees or interest you didn't expect,None,"I had some dental work done in XXXX ( {$3500.00} ). On my way out and while standing at the checkout desk, my dentist 's assistant offered me a payment plan for convenience. I accepted but signed no paperwork or application of any kind, and received only a small 3-fold brochure, and a receipt for the dental work done. There was no discussion of a security fee, and nothing in the brochure referenced a security fee. Several weeks later I received my CareCredit/GE Capital Card , but no paperwork referencing a security fee. 
My first CareCredit statement was on paper and there were no references of any kind regarding a "" security fee ''. Thereafter CareCredit switched to electronic statements via email. Those emails show a digital statement, with the balance and payment due. However, there is no reference to a security fee or the security program. I have had the account on autopay since my dental visit in XXXX. 

Several months ago, I received an email from CareCredit ( now Synchrony ) about their convenient new app and so I decided to download it - and goodness! What did I find? A whopping $ XXXX MONTH security fee, which over the course of the 10 years I have had the account equals @ {$15000.00} in security fees alone. 
My account balance exceeded {$8800.00} ( far over the {$5000.00} limit, negatively impacting my credit due to "" high usage '' on a card that never left my file cabinet ). 
The cost of dental work was {$3500.00}. 
I reached out to CareCredit /Synchrony and I spoke with several customer service individuals who basically gave me the runaround when I requested to speak to a manager - of course, not available ( on at least XXXX different calls with promises of a call back- which never happened ). 
One of the customer service reps emphatically told me I did sign up for the program, so I asked that she send me verification via the original document that she claims I had signed. If it's my signature, ok fine, but if it's not, I want ALL of the fees from an unauthorized "" Security Program '' reimbursed and the funds withdrawn without my consent returned.all {$15000.00}. 

I specifically stated that unless she or her manager could reimburse me for the ENTIRETY of the fees charged, ( assuming they could not, which the customer service validated that she could not ), NO CHANGES were to be made to the account UNTIL l had the opportunity to speak with a manager or a member of their leadership team regarding the account, as I wanted to have a visit and really understand exactly how a dental bill of {$3500.00} ballooned to $ XXXX excluding the almost {$16000.00} in accumulated security fees and the interest, or interest upon interest... 
I requested a line item breakdown of the account charges, fees, interest, and interest on the interest that had compounded over time for the life of the account. Specifically, I was looking for how much the security fees had contributed to the increased balance over time, and I wanted to determine the compounded interest that I had been accumulatively charged on security fees, and the resulting continuously increasing balance. 
A week or so later ( XX/XX/XXXX ) I received an automated letter of verification ( not a copy of the original document with my signature that I had requested ), confirming that I had been enrolled in the security program since XX/XX/XXXX. ( Had I known that the Security Program pays off your debt up to $ XXXX in the event of job loss, I most certainly would have taken advantage of that during XXXX! ) Approximately a week later, the Care Credit App on my phone alerts a notification, and it appears that Synchrony has credited my account {$1500.00} ( not {$15000.00} ) for my Card Security Debt Cancellation. And so now they have my XXXX AND they have canceled the coverage despite my specific request for no changes to be made until I can speak to someone higher up at Synchrony. 
I reached again to Customer Service and again, and the runaround, and promises of callbacks. I received one voicemail ( the phone did not ring ) whereby a Synchrony "" Manager '' left me a message to call her back- alas, no name and no telephone number was shared in ther message - caller ID did not reveal a number. 
After several more attempts to speak with someone, I check the mail and see I have received yet another letter from Synchrony ( XX/XX/XXXX ) with my "" new '' terms and of course, no reference to the Security Program for which I have now "" invested '' in to the tune of $ XXXX. 

I am in desperate need of resolution regarding this matter as it is obvious that they made the changes to my account in an effort to abscond with monies and hide their deceptive practices, which I dare say consists of theft and fraudulent behavior, but also has - and continues to - cause great harm to my credit, affecting all other critical ( and financially related ) aspects of my life... anywhere that credit and usage of credit is a key component in decision-making. 
As it so happens, I was laid off prior to my inquiry with CareCredit ( though I did not reveal this ), and I suspect they may have done a bit of research, come to that determination, and decided to head off any claims I might have submitted, in advance. 

As of now, I believe that it would not beyond the scope of appropriate remedies to request that the remaining existing account debt receive a full credit reimbursement, as well as return the nearly {$16000.00} in Security Fees to my bank account from which they were illegally withdrawn without my knowledge, authorization, or consent ; the interest earned on those fees, and the interest upon interest earned on those fees, and any additional monetary penalties that can be attributed to Synchrony Bank 's deceptive and harmful trade practices, and to make good on the reputational and financial damage they have incurred.

On XX/XX/2023, as the original creditor, private investor I extended credits to you for the applicant/principal, consumer based on the information in the credit application. I did not extend credits to the applicant to be determined by the applicant consumer report. 

2. 15 USC 1681a ( I ) ( 1 ) The consumer being determined, based on information in the consumers application for the credit or insurance, to meet specific criteria bearing on credit worthiness or insurability, as applicable, that are established ( A ) before selection of the consumer for the offer ; and ( B ) for the purpose of determining whether to extend credit or insurance pursuant to the offer. 
Before selection of the consumer for the offer it was fully determined only the information on the credit application can be used to determine a firm offer of credit. 

3. I received a letter from you on XXXX XXXX, stating you denied the consumer/principal extension of credit based on the consumer credit report. 

This is misconception and deceit, as the private investor I was under the impression I was extending credit only based thoroughly on all information in the credit application. 

4. 15 USC 1681a ( I ) ( 2 ) ( B ) of the information in the consumers application for the credit or insurance, to determine that the consumer meets the specific criteria bearing on credit worthiness or insurability.

As the Original creditor/private investor I extended credits based on the verification of the information in the consumers application and determined that the consumer was credit worthy of the extended credits.

5. 15 U.S. Code 1681n - Civil liability for willful noncompliance By not fully complying with the terms I extended the credits to the consumer based on the information in the credit application alone, you are fully in violation of the consumer rights. Therefore, you now hold civil liability for willful noncompliance. 

6. 15 U.S. Code 1681o - Civil liability for negligent noncompliance Your negligent noncompliance by not extending the credits to the consumer is violating the rights that the consumer was granted by me as the original creditor/private investor, that was determined by the information in the credit application. 

7. The damages caused in your incompetency I have suffered negligence in my family household by not being able to acquire the necessity for my family. This is violation of my pursuit of happiness, I have been shamed, this damages my character reputation, causes mental illness, and a great deal of stress. I have fully lost trust in the banking system by you making false claims and using false records and statement materials for the approval of credit ( 31 USC 3729 ). 
The damages are in the total amount of {$100000.00} 8. My prayer in relief, I ask that you fully restore all trust within the banking system by fully extending the credits to the consumer. My research, time, labor to respond to your adverse action is valued at {$10000.00} and I should be fully compensated. The first Amendment of the U.S. Constitution protects my right to work.

01/03/23,"Payday loan, title loan, or personal loan",Installment loan,Struggling to pay your loan,None,"I contacted Conns on or around XX/XX/XXXX ( a few days before my payment was due ) to let them know I had been laid off and I wanted to see if there was a program to help me be able to maintain good standing with them. I advised I would not have the money to pay the $ XXXX monthly payment that month. 

I was told by the call center that they allowed people to defer payments until the end of the loan and this program would enable me to pause payments until XX/XX/XXXX without affecting my standing with Conns or my credit report. 

The only catch was I had to wait until I missed my actual payment and then call. I asked the agent if I would have to pay anything and he again said they would just extend the loan and defer payments. I was really grateful and thought I understood because of the student loan payment deferral processit sounded the same. I was relieved because I told him I didnt have any money to put towards it and didnt want to get behind or have it affect my credit. I was assured once they started the deferral it wouldnt show past due or missed payments. 

So I called back a few times between then and sometime around XX/XX/XXXX at which point I was told you actually have to wait until your bill cycles and youre like 30 days past due not just missed the due date on the bill. So again I waited. 

During that waiting period I received lots of texts and emails and calls ( where no voicemail was left but Id get calls like XXXX times a day ) and information saying I could easily get caught up by making my paymentbut they already knew I was laid off and didnt have money. I was also sick and stressed and trusted I was good because I was told that I would put on the deferral. 

I called a few days after XXXX to make sure it was enough time. At this point the person informs me I am XXXX days past due and owe like $ XXXX and XXXX cant defer a payment without making a payment that was almost the same amount as my missed payment. They requested like {$170.00} something and I told them if I had that amount of money I wouldnt have been behind on my payment anyway. 

I advised I was still unable to find a new job due to the type of work I do not hiring during the holidays. I wasnt given any reason why I wasnt told about the payment. I asked why I was unable to get on the deferral without a payment when I was told I had to be past due. There are no clear answers and XXXX told they will not stop calling me unless I schedule a payment. I agree to make a full payment on XX/XX/XXXX because I know I will be able to do so at that point. They told me it had to be much sooner. 

So I agree to make a of {$30.00} on Tuesday XX/XX/XXXX because I know I will be able to come up with that amount by then. They then ask for which debit card they can draft it from and I tell them I dont know because my accounts are overdrawn and I dont know which one will be easier to get current to give them the money. They said without giving them a card number to draft it from they wont be able to stop calling me. 

So I asked them to notate the account that I would pay {$30.00} on XX/XX/XXXX and promised to call back. 

When I called back today XX/XX/XXXX I was told that I needed to pay almost the full payment amount and I owe $ XXXX dollars even though XXXX still only XXXX something days past due. They tell me to get on the deferment I need to pay like {$180.00}. I asked why it was more than the other day and was not given an answer. 

I told them I was confused why they didnt count my XXXX payment as the start of deferral and asked why I had to get behind in order for them to work with me. I mentioned I had always had a good history with them ( it had been around 16 months since my first payment and I had even paid extra towards my loan ). 

I asked if we could speak with a supervisor to override what the system was asking and they agreed to but came back again saying they couldnt and I needed to essentially make a full payment to get on the deferment. 

XXXX nervous that after the date passed for my XXXX bill they will tack on even more fees. 

Ive advised again and again that I want to make an agreement. Ive lived up to every agreement Ive made in this process and paid the {$30.00} today. I advised I would try to call back and pay {$20.00} on Tuesday the XXXX of XXXX. I was told again that it wasnt enough for them to work with me. 

All of this is radically different to what I understood from my first few calls to their department. It feels like I was tricked into complacency so they could add on late fees etc. I tried to get ahead of this before it became a problem and I was told they couldnt do anything until I was past due and I was told on XXXX different occasions that I wasnt behind enough for them to work with me on a plan and then they changed what they said and told me I would have to make a payment that was like 90 % of what my normal payment was to qualify for the deferment and the fees keep stacking up. 

Now my credit is being affected and XXXX getting non-stop calls and texts and emails that mention theyre willing to work with me but theres no actual offer to work with me to protect my credit. I am stressed to the XXXX and feel like they are spending more money pestering me than they stand to gain from me agreeing to pay their deferral plan entry fee that I wasnt advised of. It doesnt even make smart business sense to go after someone so aggressively when I have been reaching out to them before this became an issue to try and resolve.

I applied for one on line, and then I received a barrage of texts and emails from other lenders, which confused me. 
One company in particular represented that I had already applied and been approved for a loan, but I didn't think that I had actually applied at first. I must have, because they had my credit union account information. 
I looked at the terms and knew that it was a usary rate, so I went looked at reviews of on-line loan companies and ultilmately chose a different one. 
A few days later, {$800.00} was depostied into my checking account by Explore credit, which is the company that I desribed above as having represented that I had been approved for a load that I did not remember applying for. 
When automatic payments to pay off the {$800.00} dollars started coming out of my account, I firgured I should repay the money that they deposited into my account. 
I didn't notice at that time, but the company was taking automatic payments ever two weeks of {$210.00} for an XXXX dollar loan. I noticed two payments, and thought it was coming out monthly. 
In mid-XXXX  of this year, I started receiving texts from Explore Credit about a missed payment. I had been overdrawn, as I am separated and struggling to make ends meet at the moment. 
So I went onto their webiste, and created a login, and went to the portal to schedule a payment. 
The amount that it stated I currently owed was around {$1300.00}. I would state the exact amount, but it changed literally as I watched it, the amount jumped /changed to over {$4000.00}. I think approx {$4800.00}. I was certain this was just a mistake, but then I went into my credit union records, and they had been extracting {$210.00} every two weeks.

I tried texting back one of the representatives that had been texting me, and they urged me to get on the phone to renegoaiate. So then I went to the XXXX XXXX XXXX website, and read many, many complaints against them. They have a rating of an F.

Please notice that this is the information that they put in their statements : We apply any amount you pay above your Minimum Payment Due first to the balance with the highest APR, then to the balance with the next highest APR, and so on. As a result, if the APR for a Citi Flex Plan balance is higher than the APR of other balances on your Account, we will apply the amount above the Minimum Payment Due first to that Citi Flex Plan balance, and then, after that Citi Flex Plan balance has been paid in full, to the other balances. This will cause you to pay off that Citi Flex Plan balance before the end of its repayment period and may result in an amount remaining due on your next billing statement for the other balance, increasing your Adjusted New Balance on your next billing statement. 

However, when contacting CITI, the reason they gave me was that because my standard purchase balance was still unbilled when the payment was made, it covered the flex loan instead. 

A more transparent way to do this would be to separate the balances into different accounts so the consumer can direct their payment towards the desire account.

I was enduring some hardship at the time and trying to repair my credit. I gave the company a call and they wanted to run my credit. I politely declined and told them that I didn't want to have my credit ran as it would drop my score that I was working towards repairing. Later on I received another call from Title Max with someone telling me I didn't need to give them my social or have my credit ran. I live over an hour away from the store and I was told that if I had the title with me I could bring it to them and they would give me {$10000.00}. We were greeted with crayons and coloring pages for my son and offered refreshments. Such a nice experience or so it seemed. I was told that if I didn't spend it that I could return it and back out in 30 days. Just give the {$10000.00} back and get my title back. When I advised that I would return it I was told that I would have to also pay {$1400.00} additional even though I didn't spend the {$10000.00}. I was very upset and didn't understand how I would be able to pay this off. How does anyone pay off such a short term loan when the APR is 169.29 %? I was talked into just paying the {$1400.00} XXXX. I was never told that it was {$1400.00} a month and nothing goes towards the {$10000.00} payment. Then I was told to come in XXXX and resign. No biggie they told me. They should have explained that it wasn't a yearly APR of 169.29 % over a year and that the {$1400.00} fee was actually monthly and not over a year span of time. They said they would work with me and that the holidays were right around the corner and I would need the money for my Son and for us to live off of since at the time I was considered a Homeless Veteran. We were traveling back and forth for medical care several hours away and living in Hotels while trying to get assistance and help turning a small building into a tiny home. The following payment that was due was very hard for me to make. Although I did. The third payment I was told they were going to repossess our car and that since I was not in Texas they could not take my payment. I was told that I could talk to my bank and see if they would buy the loan. The same bank where I make the payments to on the car. The bank advised me that it was not legal for them to give me the loan if I make payments on the vehicle and that I should reach out to JAG at the VA. I relayed this to TitleMax and the lady explained that it was definitely illegal for them to give me the loan and that she would reach out to her supervisor and then to their Legal Team. I was advised to wait for their Legal team to contact me. I kept getting texts and I called Titlemax each time and they told me to just keep waiting. I got a call I believe in XXXX with a lady yelling at me and telling me they were looking for my car and going to take it. She said they found out I was not on XXXX XXXX and I owe them the money. No where did I ever say I was on XXXX XXXX. I am a XXXX veteran. They know this because the guy initially wanted to see and make a copy of my award letter in order for me to get the loan. All calls ceased and I called the store many times and was told to wait for legal to call me as I was told before. In XXXX I got a call from a new supervisor at Title Max who asked that I explain everything to him. I did and he was going to be getting back in touch with me. He did not. In XX/XX/XXXX a lady from Title Max Collection Department called and I was asked what my intentions were and I stated that I did borrow the money and I intended to pay it back. Although I wasn't able to speak about the situation at the moment and she said fine, they are coming to get the car. I explained that we were having to live in our car at times and all of my valuable posessions and personal and private paperwork and documents were in there and that the car is specific to meet my XXXX needs. She told me they owned the car and they were coming to get it and that we couldn't live in it forever and as soon as we get out of it that they would come and get it. On XX/XX/XXXX the people came to repossess my car and I refused to let them take it. I literally begged them in complete fear and shame while my Son had to watch all of this and they had me call Title Max and and try and work a plan out with them. Title Max would not and the guys were advised to take my car. They asked that I please keep my word and figure out how to pay Title Max to prevent the loss of my car.

This was not the agreement we had and I was very upset. The representative explained she did not tell me {$2000.00} that she told me {$3000.00}. When I explained to her that my calls are recorded she then stated that she must have made a mistake and that she was only human and she apologized. She would have her supervisor call me. Later in the day on XX/XX/XXXX after I made the arranged {$2000.00} payment the supervisor called me and said this was a mistake and they will take increments of {$2000.00} and they will just have me pay another {$2000.00} in XXXX. She said they can make deals but not like that even though the original TM store got over {$3000.00} from me, she stated that it was not towards the loan. Only a promise to pay to the store and that I owed {$12000.00} when the loan went to them at collections and that's what they intended to collect from me.

06/11/23,"Payday loan, title loan, or personal loan",Personal line of credit,Charged fees or interest you didn't expect,None,"Dear Sir/Madam, I am writing to raise a serious concern regarding the services provided by Synchrony Bank . My complaint centers around the wrongful application of a promotional financing period to my account and the absence of financial statements in my online portal. 

In XX/XX/XXXX, I agreed to a promotional financing period with Synchrony Bank, expected to last until XX/XX/XXXX. Regrettably, the bank initiated this period two months earlier than agreed, thereby shortening the duration I was promised. This unexpected alteration has caused financial strain and a clear violation of our agreement 's terms. 

Additionally, I have not received any financial statements related to this account, nor can I access them through my online portal. The absence of these crucial documents further exacerbates the issue, preventing me from fully understanding the implications of the changes made to my account. 

I have made significant efforts to address this issue directly with Synchrony Bank. I have spoken to several representatives, namely XXXX ( Employee ID XXXX ), XXXX, and XXXX, but my concerns remain unresolved. 

I respectfully request the CFPB to investigate this matter. My expectation is for Synchrony Bank to honor the original terms of our agreement, adjusting my promotional financing period correctly, and reversing any additional charges incurred due to their error. Furthermore, I seek assistance in obtaining access to my financial statements, either through postal delivery or via my online portal. I don't even have access to an account number, XXXX is all I have. 

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I trust in the CFPB 's commitment to consumer protection and look forward to a prompt resolution that will restore my faith in the banking sector.

I now believe this to be predatory lending. 

In addition, I have had many issues making payments. I went into the bank with my parents and we paid {$15000.00} toward the loan with the {$15000.00} balance. The bank then immediately closed this account- later claiming I requested the closure - damaging my credit. This was not a request I made at any point to close the account. 

Then a few weeks later they closed the second line of credit with {$25000.00} owed and charged it off. This account now sits in their internal collections office- where they collect the payments + interest and penalties. 

Please note I also have a credit card and a third line of credit with them. Santander then proceeded to shut off my access to online banking making it impossible to see the balances of any of the accounts online or to set up auto-pay. 

I have made payment arrangements- for the first few years, they had one group that collected a lump payment from me that Santander Bank applied across multiple accounts. Then without any indication that had changed, they split this up into different payment groups. I continued making my payments assuming they were being slipt up.

I have identified several violations of my rights under the Fair Credit Reporting Act, including violations of 15 USC 1666b, 15 U.S. Code 1666, and 15 USC 1681b, which I would like to bring to your attention. 

Specifically, Experian has treated payments on my credit card account as late, even though I made the payments on time. This violates my right to have accurate information on my credit report, as guaranteed by the Fair Credit Reporting Act and 15 USC 1666b. Additionally, Experian has failed to correct billing errors on my account, in violation of 15 U.S. Code 1666. 

Furthermore, Experian has accessed my credit report without a permissible purpose, in violation of 15 USC 1681b. According to this law, a credit reporting agency may only provide a credit report to someone who has a permissible purpose, such as a creditor or employer who is considering extending credit or offering employment. However, Experian accessed my credit report without a permissible purpose, which violates my right to privacy and my right to control who has access to my credit report. 

These violations have caused me significant financial and emotional distress. As a result of these inaccurate late payment reports and billing errors, my credit score has been negatively impacted, and I have been denied credit and other financial opportunities. For example, I was recently denied a loan for bad credit debt, late payments, over utilization of accounts that are not even mine. 

Additionally, the unauthorized access to my credit report by Experian, XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX  and XXXX XXXX XXXX, has caused me to worry about identity theft and other forms of financial harm. 

I am requesting that you delete all derogatory accounts, tradelines and lines of credit, update all late payments to current.

I received an adverse action letter stating I was denied. I am not attempting to be troublesome nor am I outright disagreeing with your company 's decision. I would just like to know what laws and procedures were used to come to this determination. 

Companies procedure does not supersede federal law. This is a direct violation of my rights of consumer 15 usc 1602 ( f ) tell me credit is my right. I can not be denied a right. 15 usc 1602 ( p ) makes it clear that you committed fraud and used my credit card without authority, and I received no benefits. Now I would hate for this situation to escalate. I am sure you're just doing your job, but I would now have to hold you personally liable for this.

Federal Reserve section 16 part 2 says my application was the collateral and it says that the collateral is worth dollar for dollar for the value of the federal note that was taken from the federal reserve bank. So, since those Federal reserve notes was exchanged they wasn't even exchanged so I would like to use the credits that arised from that transaction. I would like to apply it to the principal account. 

Also, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act prohibits creditors from discriminating against credit applicants. I have been discriminated against, on the basis of race and defamation of character.

Prior to sending XXXX XXXX a rebuttal, The Consumer wanted to ensure submission of his rebuttal here first. In addition to calling the Consumer a liar, XXXX XXXX has continued to ignore the Consumer in addressing his requests today as he is attaching for review to forward this information to the appropriate personnel, including XXXX XXXX to whom it is specifically addressed, for proper processing. It is the Consumer 's belief that XXXX XXXX is in collusion to Corporate/Industrial Espionage based on the way he has chosen to do business. It is the Consumer 's intent at this point to deescalate this matter with a proposed solution of submitting his personal & business information to or for all credit lending products offered at Renasant Bank for some form of appropriate closure for clarification purposes. Thank you for your time and any assistance that you may be able to provide. Original Complaint summary below. Respectfully - XXXX XXXX XXXX This Affidavit of Truth is prepared by XXXX XXXX XXXX ( the Consumer & Plaintiff ) is truthfully alleging that Renasant Bank ( Witness, Defendant ) willfully violated a multitude of Consumer Protection Laws because they have not offered any Adverse Decision regarding a Business Loan, Line of Credit, or Asset-Based Loan for the Consumer. In addition, Renasant Bank has also violated several laws regarding Fair Lending Practices & have even violated their own Account Agreement & Disclosures, by not equally treating the Consumer fair as other Business Clients/Consumers. As of today, Renasant Bank has failed to offer or set of policies and programs aimed at increasing the representation and opportunities for historically disadvantaged or underrepresented groups in areas such as fair lending, general customer service for all customers in whole or in part, defined as Affirmative Action. The goal of affirmative action is to address past and present discrimination, systemic inequalities, and underrepresentation of certain groups by promoting diversity and equal access to opportunities all of which Renasant Bank has failed to provide to the Consumer. The Consumer has solely led astray by the Defendant ( i.e. Specifically XXXX XXXX XXXX - XXXX, GA. Branch Manager ) for roughly over two ( XXXX ) months. Within this same time frame, the Consumer also experienced financial hardships related & unrelated to this matter. Around XXXX of XXXX, the Consumer informed XXXX XXXX of his interest in purchasing his business equipment upon its expiration date of XX/XX/XXXX. During this time the Consumer would build his credit, assets, & revenue in preparation for the lease expiration date with establishing himself as a new Customer driven with purpose. Based on the lease semi-tractor title having a previously lien by Renasant Bank, the Consumer hoped that his business relationship would carryover in a long term healthy report. Unfortunately, XXXX XXXX has failed the Consumer in fulfillment of those plans by using Unfair, Deceptive, or Abusive Acts or Practices known as UDAAPs. A prime example is how XXXX XXXX understood the Consumers goals and requested a lengthy list of items & documents to increase the Consumers chances of approval for a minimum amount only to deny the Consumer for those very same reasons without providing any Adverse Action Letter thereafter ( i.e. Business Plan, Projected Revenue, Tax Documents, etc. ) Since XXXX XXXX has verbally declined the Consumer, the consumer is only led to believe that XXXX XXXX solely & willfully illegally Declined the Consumer without cause, with spite, & after obtaining a plethora of detailed information/intellectual property from the Consumer. This unjust service warrants unfair practices brought about against the Defendants. The Consumer has been very patient & diligent in cooperating with the Defendants application process, yet he is now only left to believe that Renasant Bank is currently & intentionally violating his consumer rights. In addition, XXXX XXXX solely took it upon himself to verbally state that a Consumers check would be honored within a reasonable time of XXXX days at his sole discretion on XX/XX/XXXX. Unfortunately, XXXX attempted to deceive the Consumer by attempting to distract while this deposit was being transacted, & while also instructing his associate to stamp the receipt for XXXXday hold or more ( Documents Attached ). Had XXXX XXXX told the truth in response to the Consumers inquiry, the Consumer/Customer would have explored other options to obtain the needed cash sooner. As of today ( XX/XX/XXXX ), XXXX XXXX has continued to violate the Consumers Rights by doing the exact same thing from XX/XX/XXXX only this time it is transparently clear & conspicuous of his wrongdoings. When the Consumer contacted Renasant Banks Corporate Office, he was informed that at XXXX XXXX sole discretion, he has placed the Consumers account in pending closure status prior to the deadline of the Banks policy of account delinquency for XXXX days. As such, XXXX XXXX has continued to violate Consumer Laws & his very own Banking Procedures with the effortless lackadaisical service towards the Consumer of this Claim. Hopefully, Renasant Bank is dedicated to ensuring that the Consumer has an equitable chance to secure a viable lending solution, taking into account both the relevant and unrelated facts as confirmed under oath. As part of its commitment to treating all consumers fairly, the Bank should be optimistic about creating a positive lending experience for the Consumer involved in this matter, current consumers being mistreated, & all other consumers within our society-at-large that may follow.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,RENASANT CORPORATION,GA,XXXXX,None,Consent provided,Web,08/04/23,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,7350033

After endless attempts to resolve this matter over the last two months with phone calls, emails, and filed investigations with customer service agents, managers, supervisors, back-office investigators we can not reach any Upstart employee with the capacity to resolve this issue. 

Now I will present a series of events that will clearly show that the loan is paid in full, and the actions taken by Upstart show negligence and a potential, tomorrow if not resolved, to be a clear violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act for false reporting. As I write this letter, Upstart is threatening to send myself to collections on XX/XX/XXXX for a loan that we have already paid in full and no longer have with your company. 

Here is the summary of the events and documents that will clearly show my Upstart loan is paid in full as of XX/XX/XXXX ( please see confirmation email from Upstart and XXXX XXXX confirmation ). 

***Please note this must be resolved on Monday XX/XX/XXXX. I am currently filling a report and calling the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, The Department of Financial Protection and Innovation, The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ( FDIC ), California Attorney General, The XXXX XXXX XXXX, and seeking legal protection if needed. I will not stop until you assure me this never happens to a borrower again. 

Here are the events : Loan start date XX/XX/XXXXXXXX XXXX  complete a cash out refinance through our home lender XXXX with the goal of paying off higher interest debt. The title company used was XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. 
XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX issued XXXX XXXX XXXX # XXXX on XX/XX/XXXXXXXX  : Mailed to Upstart via United States Postal Service ( standard mail ) Called several times during the month of XXXX to confirm if payment received. Upstart informed to call back and check not received. 
XX/XX/XXXX called Upstart again and informed check had not been received and Upstart recommended sending a new check. Also, Upstart stated that if a payment was not made by XX/XX/XXXX ( for the month of XXXX ) the account would be late and I would be reported to collections. 
Payment was made on XX/XX/XXXX, in the amount of {$1200.00}. 
XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX was contacted and asked to cancel the XXXX check # : XXXX A new check was issued. Check # XXXX in the amount of {$39000.00}. The check was mailed overnight on Thursday, XX/XX/XXXX via United States Postal Service. 
Email confirmation was received from Upstart on Friday, XX/XX/XXXX stating that the loan was paid in full, and the loan was overpaid by {$2100.00}. 
Friday XX/XX/XXXX over payment re-fund was not received. I placed a call on XX/XX/XXXX, and spoke with Upstart customer service agent XXXX and she provided the following information : o The loan is paid in full, and a refund is due ( confirmation above by email and below by app screenshot ) : o To receive a refund, I needed to call to initiate the bank transfer ( Please note this is in direct conflict to what the email confirmation above states ) o XXXX initiated the refund and over payment in the amount of {$2100.00}.

We confirmed that XXXX XXXX XXXX had already canceled the first check, the loan had been paid in full on XX/XX/XXXX, and yes please cancel the first check that Upstart had lost. 
After our phone call with XXXX, we received the email on Tuesday XX/XX/XXXX from Upstart employee XXXX that our over payment had been issued and loan was paid in full as of the check received on XX/XX/XXXX : Thursday XX/XX/XXXXXXXX XXXX we received and email that the payment on XX/XX/XXXX for {$39000.00} had failed and we owed a {$15.00} fee. 
Friday XX/XX/XXXXXXXX XXXX  : I Called Upstart in reference to the message saying our payment had failed and an investigation was opened. 
Wednesday XX/XX/XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Called Upstart four separate times during my workday and with my husband XXXX XXXX to hopefully talk to an Upstart employee that could quickly resolve this issue. Additionally, investigations filed, and the following email received stating that we owe {$1200.00} ( includes a late fee ) Wednesday XX/XX/XXXXXXXX XXXX  : Email received from XXXX at Upstart stating that an in depth investigation was now occurring Wednesday XX/XX/XXXX : Multiple documents sent to XXXX clearly showing that check had cleared XXXX XXXX and loan closed and an explanation from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX : Wednesday XX/XX/XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX  : The following two emails were received from XXXX stating the following : o YES, we did cancel the first check with your customer service agent XXXX because we already sent the second check ( which can be viewed above ), cashed by Upstart, confirmed by XXXX XXXX, confirmed by XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, overpayment received, and we did not want a situation where you would TRY TO DEPOSIT A SECOND CHECK. Which unfortunately you did. 
Thursday XX/XX/XXXX : Called Upstart and spoke with customer service employee XXXX you informed us that XXXX was in contact with the Upstart Treasury department and she would have an answer for us by Friday XX/XX/XXXX. 
Friday XX/XX/XXXX : Final email from XXXX at Upstart stating the following : As you can see there is some serious confusion happening here. First, yes, we did cancel the 1st check ( Check # : XXXX ), that you likely misplaced, and sent a second check ( Check # : XXXX ) which cashed by Upstart on XX/XX/XXXX. XXXX is saying that somehow our lender XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX canceled a check that you deposited weeks earlier on XX/XX/XXXX ( see image above with deposit date ). None of this makes any sense at all. 
Friday XX/XX/XXXX : With XXXX XXXX from XXXX XXXX XXXX services and my husband XXXX XXXX we called Upstart to hopefully bring this to resolution before we are reported to collections. We talked to Upstart employee XXXX who was helpful and tried everything she could to reach a manager but was unable to. She did inform us of two Upstart managers named XXXX and XXXX who could potentially assist us with this is matter. We have not heard from either. 

In summary over the last two months, my husband and I spent over a minimum of 6 hours on the phone with Upstart, 10 hours combined of lost work time, 16 hours of combined XXXX, and a very stressful family vacation knowing this was not being resolved. I hope you can imagine the extreme emotional stress of paying of a loan of over {$39000.00} and then having it reinstated and the complete and utter negligence of Upstart to resolve what is likely a simple clerical or computer error. The reality is we do not have our money, totally {$39000.00}, for over the last two months and neither does XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. In addition, Upstart is threatening to send us to collections end of day on XX/XX/XXXXXXXX  for a loan that has been paid in full and about to make a negligent false claim to the credit bureaus. 
This must be resolved by today Monday XX/XX/XXXX, not tomorrow, not this week, today.

Im urgently complaining about UPSTART 's refusal to remove an erroneous 30-day late payment they caused. Despite my attempts to resolve this, they have disregarded my requests for resolution, prompting me to seek your intervention. UPSTART continues reporting an erroneous 30-day late payment in XX/XX/2023 due to there company deducting the payment from the wrong bank account, despite my providing them my correct banking information. I had called them in XX/XX/2023, when they first made this mistake and I was assured once I provided them with my correct banking information that this would NOT happen again. However, they continued to withdraw from the INCORRECT bank account and this has caused me a 30-day late payment, distress, a credit denial, and a negative impact on my credit report. 

I request your assistance in compelling UPSTART to promptly remove the erroneous 30-day late payment from my credit report. ( Please note ) : My account is good standing and up-to-date ( Plus advance/extra payments ). I have also ( prior to this incident ), paid Upstart advance payments. I have never had a 30 day late mark on my Credit Reports/Bureaus etc. ( I have NO late payments with any other companies, that I have accounts/business with. ( Until this incident with UPSTART happened ), My credit history always showed "" EXCELLENT PAYMENT '' category on my credit Bureaus.

On XX/XX/2023 I used their customer support email rather than their virtual chat so that I may retain a record. The following is a summary of events from that date until now. 

XX/XX/XXXX : Zip replied to my email notifying them that the loan amount was incorrect and the discount was missing. They told me that I had signed up for an account in XXXX of this year. I informed them I did not willingly sign up for any such account. 

XX/XX/XXXX : I received another email reiterating that they believed I did create an account in XX/XX/2023. I explained to them no, I did not nor did I authorize anyone to create such an account. I expressed my concern that if clicking a website link automatically generated a line of credit that is not only concerning, but not okay. 

XX/XX/XXXX : They repeat the same thing about the account being created in XXXX, but don't address my concern about the {$10.00} credit or how the account was created in the first place. I respond repeating myself. 

XX/XX/XXXX : I receive a reply saying that the matter has been referred to another internal team and to await a response. 

XX/XX/XXXX : I receive a reply from a different agent asking me to provide proof of the discount in question. I provide a screenshot to them and explain what is wrong with the loan and how it should be reduced by {$10.00} given the fact I was within the terms of the advertisement. 

XX/XX/XXXX later in the day : I receive the same repeated response as prior to XX/XX/XXXX and I respond to them to read the notes of the prior emails to indicate that it is incorrect. 

XX/XX/XXXX even later in the day : They repeat the same line again about the account being created in XXXX without answering my question on how the account was created. I repeat again to please read the prior emails of me explaining that I did not to my knowledge create any such account nor does the offer advertisement that I provided say that just creating an account without transacting. I ask them to please assist me as this has become a tedious back and forth. 

XX/XX/XXXX : The same response. I respond with asking my issue to be escalated. I do not receive a reply. 

XX/XX/XXXX : I follow up on the matter and do not receive a response.

From the very beginning Lending Point has been very difficult to work with and saying that they need information. First they said that they need a police report to start their investigation. I did that. Then they said they need more, so I got what they told me they needed. Then finally i heard back from somebody who said they were actually investigating it. That person connected me to XXXX  XXXX XXXX where there was a fradulent account in my name that was setup. Whoever stole my identity took out this loan and transferred the money to a XXXX XXXX  XXXX account. From there, they clarified that I need more details added to the police report so that they can subpoena the bank records and finish their investigation. At every interaction ( email attached ) they have moved the goalposts and not done anything to make me feel at all confident that they are actually investigating this claim in good faith.

I left Truist ( BB & T ) as an employee in XXXX because I did not agree with some of the things I saw happening to not only employees but also the customers. This line of credit matured XX/XX/XXXX. It had {$100.00} annual fee that was supposed to be charged at origination and every anniversary until maturity as it states in the loan agreement. At maturity Truist decided to charge me another {$100.00} annual fee but the line of credit was already closed. I spent over 43 hours on the phone and in branches trying to resolve this while getting hung up on numerous of times, promised calls back that never happened. I filed a complaint with the CFPB and that is when I got Truist 's attention. A lady out of GA reached out to handle the complaint. She left a response stating that I was still responsible for the annual fee that they assessed after maturity. So I was being charged 4 annual fees on a 3 year line of credit. What is not seen in her response is that she called me afterwards to say that she agreed that I should not have been charged the {$100.00} fee with the line of credit being closed. She sent out a check for the {$100.00} in the mail to me. Fast forward to XXXX. The line of credit has been closed out for over a year now. I just received a letter in the mail stating that Truist has charged yet another {$100.00} annual fee on this closed out line of credit. It also shows again that there is {$0.00} available balance.

On XX/XX/XXXX I opened up a loan with Self Financial Inc of {$1600.00} that specifically stated how I would have roughly 12 months to pay off. I opened this account because it was to build up my credit, they would first have me pay off the loan amount and then send out the payment to me. They then offered me a secured credit card, which I opened up and deposited a portion of the loan I had already given them. This resulted in my new payout amount dropping from {$1600.00} to {$980.00}, again this was due to the fact that I funded the secured credit card with the deposit I had initiated with the money I had already given them. I would have to pay a minimum of {$140.00} a month, however, I finished this loan early on XX/XX/XXXX, and they responded with an email saying how they would send out my loan payment through direct deposit and that its arrival date would be XX/XX/XXXX ; the amount of {$980.00}.

I have always paid payments on time since this loan first started in XXXX. I was able to benefit from their pandemic forbearance program during the Covid disruptions. The scheme was set up in a confusing fashion by Discover Loans, though. Despite the fact that Discover had me signed up for this service, they kept contacting and demanding monthly payments. I asked Discover staff why payments were required even though the loan was in forbearance, and they used a tactic where they passed me from person to person, each of whom gave me different information. This forced me to merely make a payment to be in the clear and to avoid harming my credit. 
They persisted in doing that during the entire epidemic, and in XX/XX/XXXX, even though I was enrolled in the special payment program, they reported me as being 60 days past due. Normal monthly payments had resumed at $ XXXXmonth for more than a year until XX/XX/XXXX, when I enrolled in a program with lower payments that would let me pay $ XXXXmonth for nine months ( Reduced payment program ). Discover continued to call me while I was enrolled in this program and paying the $ 250 monthly payment, demanding the entire amount that they claimed is past due. 
My credit limit was recently reduced by XXXX XXXX on of my credit cards, according to a letter I recently got from the bank due a derogatory remarks on my credit report. When I reviewed my credit reports with the three credit bureaus, I saw that Discover has been reporting my late payments to XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX since XX/XX/XXXX, respectively.

Discover never once gave me the correct answer. They either use the transfer to different agents trick, drop the call after telling you they will transfer you, or simply say they have no idea and still demand {$1600.00} or whatever amount they claim is past due. I called a few days ago and was transferred to two different agents. One of them was a manager, and at the end of the call she informed me that she does not have any expertise in personal loans and is only trained in student loans, and she promised to leave a message for someone to call me back.

I am writing this letter to the executive leadership team of XXXX, the financial holding company of American First Finance, and to report to Consumer Protection Agencies listed above to inform of the deceitiful and injustice policies of American First Financial maintains. 

I took out a XXXX  days loan of {$990.00} to purchase a refrigerator on or around the second week of XXXX which has an Early Purchase Option Amount in which I have 0 % interest loan. To avoid balloon loan payments that will double the cost of the initial purchase to {$2000.00}, I called and spoke to the American First Finance Representative and asked to make a credit card payment to pay off the balance on the account of {$470.00} - see below. The Representative stated that the company can NOT accept credit card payments only debit card payments. I asked her to explain why credit card payments are not a form of payment and she could not explain the policy. I asked to speak to her manager, and I was abruptly disconnected. 

Using a credit card is a legal monetary tender, and I was denied the right to use this tender. I recognize there is a nominal fee associated with the credit card transaction and I am happy to defray the fees associated with using a credit card. I believe American First Financial uses the no credit card processing policy as a deceitful and unfair policy to keep the American public indebted to their financial institution.

06/07/23,"Payday loan, title loan, or personal loan",Installment loan,Incorrect information on your report,Account information incorrect,"I secured a personal loan with First Midwest Bank XX/XX/XXXX. The loan officer, XXXX XXXX, set my account payment to monthly auto draft. For the past 4 years, my payment has been made on time, with no charge backs, through auto draft. According to contract terms. Loan was set to mature XX/XX/XXXX. First Midwest Bank merged to Old National Bank in XXXX, carrying over my loan. Auto draft of monthly payments continued as previous, with no interruptions. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I received an email from my credit monitoring service. It stated my credit score had dropped from XXXX to XXXX, because Old National had reported my account as 30 days past due. I have never received any correspondence from Old National Bank of this ; I was under the impression that this loan was fully paid off, as it had always auto drafted, and maturity had reached. 

I called to inquire about what was happening, and to have the credit reporting reversed. I spoke with customer service, and then a supervisor. This was the first time I was made aware that the policy for the final payment is that it can't be auto drafted. Nowhere in my signed contractual agreement with First Midwest Bank does it state this. The supervisor ( XXXX XXXX, stated they would submit a claim for review, and that they would call back within the week to discuss results. At the time of call, XXXX also told me that my final payment was {$400.00}, and that this policy was of Old National ; not First Midwest. 

I did not receive a call back from anyone. On XX/XX/XXXX, I called back. I spoke with customer service, and another supervisor. I was told the negative credit report would not be reversed. This verdict is unacceptable to me, as this is not my error, and clearly something that got lost on their end in transition with the merger. Thus, this should be considered a bank error. At the time of call, the supervisor also now told me this was a First Midwest policy, and should be in my original contract ( it is not ). Supervisor submitted another dispute on my behalf, and then transferred me to collections to pay off remaining balance. 

When I spoke to collections, they also stated this was a First Midwest Policy, and that it should have been on my auto draft form which I signed. Again, It is not. They also gave me a differing pay off amount ; {$440.00}. 

I also say all of this, to show just how much conflicting misinformation is being spread through this institution, to the consumer. This whole situation has made me feel like this was a "" bait and switch '' loan operation. To try to get clarity, I decided to walk into a brick and mortar, and speak with a branch manager. I spoke with XXXX XXXX at the XXXX XXXX, Illinois location. Before speaking with them, I also interacted with a teller, who stated this was an Old National policy. Again, more conflicting information. XXXX was on my side with what had happened, and stated they would back me with my complaint to higher management. They did find that a final statement should have been sent out to me, to notify me that the last payment could only be made over the phone or in person. I did not receive any notification about this, and they can't provide any proof that I would have. XXXX did also state that their system is not reflecting that the account had been paid off, even though I had done so prior to coming in. They stated they would give it a day, and notify me if it still hasn't processed. A day later, XXXX called me to let me know that the payment had not in fact been processed by their collections department, and I would have to call and try to pay again. How is this acceptable? Had I not been in communication with a branch manager, my account would have stayed delinquent even longer. Collecting more interest. 

At our time of my meeting with XXXX, I also provided my original loan application, as well as, my full loan contract. They read through everything, and also confirmed there is nothing in the documents stating the last payment would not be auto drafted. That XXXX payments would be made ( the full amount of payments for the loan ), and showed my election of monthly auto pay. I can provide such documents here too. 

At this time I am asking for the bank to reverse the negative credit reporting. How is it acceptable for an organization to ruin someones credit for 7 years, over them not honoring a legal contract, and stating they mailed me something with no proof of delivery. Why does their word grant more importance than my word, or my proof of legal documentation? I have paid this loan correctly for 4 years, I have had an exceptional credit rating for years as well. Why would I ruin that for the last payment? I have filed a dispute directly with the credit bureaus. However, with comments being limited to only 200 characters, It's impossible to clearly state what has happened. At the time of submitting this the 30 day delinquency is still on my credit report.

I was very stressed at that time because I didn't have enough money to keep paying for it and I couldn't ask anyone to help me pay for it. Because I also pay for my own car monthly. My car monthly was around {$500.00} a month. 
So I called the loan company which is Koafafi. They were pretty rude and I was upset, I tried my best to explain my situation. They said they couldn't do anything about it. They said it was my fault that it was canceled and I didn't change my card information. They told me I didn't pay on time, but I did. They said I still need to pay them the rest amount. I told them I couldn't afford that time and I was struggling mentally and financially.

07/17/23,"Payday loan, title loan, or personal loan",Installment loan,Problem with a credit reporting company's investigation into an existing problem,Their investigation did not fix an error on your report,"In XXXX XXXX XXXX  and XXXX were just beginning. I was buying something online and saw there was a new type of pay-in-equal payments called Affirm. These were set to automatically deduct from my checking account so I tried it on a purchase for {$100.00} and another one for {$100.00} to compare it with XXXX and XXXX. 

Nothing in the advertising mentioned a line of credit or reporting to a credit bureau however, when checking out, I was prompted for my Social Security number. I hesitated and thought was strange, but all of these types of payment methods were new at the time so I figured it was to validate my ability to repay. At checkout the verbiage pointed out that they do not use your credit for this auto pay. 

I have a membership with XXXX so I got an alert from XXXX saying that I had two new credit lines. These were the two purchases from Affirm that were supposed to be paying automatically using the debit card linked to my checking account, but they reported them both to XXXX and my credit score dropped about XXXX points! I immediately paid off what was left if both, closed my whole Affirm account, and disputed them with XXXX. 

Over the last four years I have disputed those two reportings many times, probably at least once a year to no avail. Every time was rejected. I also called Affirm multiple times and spoke with supervisors and managers who were all rude and told me that they would not remove them. They even said that they are legally required to report it, which I do not think is true, especially for minuscule amounts that should never have been a line of credit and the fact I paid them right away, notified Affirm of the issue and permanently closed my Affirm account. 

This was a case of bait and switch. They advertised their payment product as if it was pike an automatic pay-in-equal payments broken out that dont touch your credit. The payments were set up with my debit card to automatically come out of my bank, so when they hit my XXXX credit, I immediately went in to the app and paid them in full. I did not use Affirm because I needed to, but I was merely using it to try it out and compare with XXXX and XXXX 

Most recently, I asked XXXX to process a dispute on their end, and that one also was rejected. That was probably a few months ago. 

So my back is against the wall. I was absolutely devastated when this happed because it dropped my credit score by about XXXX points. I made it clear to Affirm representatives, supervisors, and managers the details of what happened as well as how it dropped my credit score and that I did not agree for them to create lines of credit and report those to XXXX, but they refused to remove it. 

These lines of credit arent bad credit either, they are actually positive however, I have credit and would never in a million years taken out two lines of credit for a {$100.00} and {$100.00} item. That is absolutely absurd.

Please see the loan document. 
On the day of the installation, which was a very hot and humid day, neither the installation manger nor the salesperson was present. The two workers had much difficulty installing the window and the door. The window and the door did not fit in the cavities, which were created as the result of removing the existing window and the door. The workers tried their best, while constantly complaining about the weather. The railings where the window and the door open and shut were mostly stuck and they were not flowing smoothly. Please see the attached sheet provided to us by XXXX. It shows how important the installation is. The installation was faulty and the door and the window appear to be used with incorrect exact measurements. 
The workers gave us a completion check out sheet to sign that the work is completed and all standards are met. We refused to sign the sheet. XXXX can not produce this signed sheet from us, which is a normal thing to do upon the work completion. 
We began to contact the company and salesperson. They were not responsive, while claiming leaving many messages which did not exit. Eventually we got XXXX, the installation manager to come out and examine the works. He was disappointed in the works performed. This was clear from his expressions and the words he was uttering. He took at least 30 pictures on his XXXX and took extensive notes. He said he would talk to the general manger, XXXX XXXX XXXX about this. 
The work required replacements of the window and the door. XXXX and XXXX XXXX did not want to do that then, days after the installation and now. The new window and the door would cost a lot for XXXX.

XXXX XXXX upon our recent contacts with him stated that there is no record/memory of our complaints and our contact with him about our problems.

They didnt get pulled until XXXX XXXX 

No other bank, that I know of, takes 3 months to set up automatic payments. 

The BOTW did not take an auto payment for XXXX or XXXX. 
I had to do it manually. When it didnt take the XXXX XXXX auto payment, I paid the {$1000.00} in XXXX. I paid that twice, again because the BOTW online app was not completing the transaction properly.

It seems to me that it is very convenient for the bank not to address the bank app situation as in the end, it generates extra income in the way of fines and interest.

Specifically, the amount of credit line used was {$2100.00} - late by 120 days. I was unaware that I had an active joint checking account with overdraft protection with TD Bank and reported it as fraud. An investigator with TD Bank concluded it was not fraud because he had a record of my signature agreeing to overdraft protection from XXXX with a bank ( XXXX XXXX XXXX ) that later merged with TD Bank. I did affirm that it was my signature, however, it was on an application and not a contract as stated and had no terms or conditions, no fee schedule, no interest rate, no information about a minimum balance for the associated checking account, or any information about the co-signer attached. The reported date in XXXX was in conflict with another record provided by TD Bank stating that the overdraft account was opened XXXX 

Speaking to several bank representatives, I discovered that the original joint checking account had been opened in XXXX with XXXX XXXX XXXX but that the signature card associated with the account pulled another customers signature from PA. There was no signature card for myself or the co-owner associated with the original account number. I believed that this checking account had been closed in XXXX and I had not received any notice at any time from TD Bank that there were funds in the account or that there had been a merger. Nor did I receive any bank statements showing that the money in the account had been reduced to a negative balance of {$49.00}, and that the overdraft fees had accumulated to over {$2000.00}. In fact the address that TD Bank had on record ( a street address ) was not a mailing address - being located in a rural area, residents were given postal boxes for mail to be delivered. Moreover, I had moved from that address in XXXX and never received any forwarded mail from TD Bank. 

In accumulating their fees, TD Bank charged the checking account until the funds were gone. At that point they withdrew funds from the overdraft protection to pay the fees and then to pay the interest on the amount of money withdrawn from the overdraft protection line of credit. This circular pattern of the bank paying itself continued with increasing dollar amounts until the credit limit of {$2000.00} was eventually reached. 

Without my affirmative consent, I believe TD Bank opened an overdraft account in my name based on an incomplete application and approval letter. Further, they attached fees to the checking account which started with a positive balance of {$1700.00}, until it was discharged at a negative balance of {$49.00}. When I requested the fee schedule, terms, interest rate, annual fees, minimum balance requirements, and monthly payments for the checking and overdraft accounts, they could not produce any records, reporting that there were no other records from the merger. They stated that the terms had been grandfathered '' after the merger with XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX but could not produce any records to this effect either. When I asked why fees were able to accumulate over a 13 year period without turning the funds over to the state after the account stopped all external activity, I was told that I had signed an agreement to pay an annual fee in addition to a minimum balance fee which was considered customer generated activity. They could not, however, produce any documents to show that I had been made aware of and agreed to these terms. 

Over the course of five weeks, I have made numerous calls to TD Banks discharge checking account and loan servicing departments, made multiple visits to branches in both Massachusetts and Vermont, and sent certified letters to the Senior VP of Customer Service and Operations Center. There has been no resolution to date. Under pressure, I paid off the balance of the line of credit to avoid defaulting on the loan and making my credit rating even worse. With the payment of fees to TD Bank, I have paid almost {$4000.00} ( {$2200.00} in overdraft fees and {$1700.00} in checking account maintenance fees ). I believe all fees should be reversed, a refund given in the same amount, and my credit restored.",None,TD BANK US HOLDING COMPANY,VT,053XX,None,Consent provided,Web,05/05/23,Closed with monetary relief,Yes,N/A,6929851

With this program, you would make monthly payments of roughly {$35.00} per month for 24 months, be sent an XXXX XXXX immediately, and after 12 months of payments, be allowed to upgrade to the new XXXX XXXX XXXX by trading in the first XXXX. This program was financed through Citizens Bank ( CB ).

Once eligible and after 12 payments, I pursued upgrading in XX/XX/XXXX. At this point, I learned that the program had been discontinued with XXXX and was spun off to XXXX. Unsure what this even meant and out of options, I followed the upgrade process through XXXX, not XXXX, and requested the "" trade-in kit '' to send back the old XXXX. After a 3-4 months delay due to supply chain logistic "" issues '', the trade-in kit finally arrived and I was able to trade it in. After ~16 payments and once the original XXXX finally made it back to XXXX XXXX my Citizens Bank balance account was zeroed out ( though, this was a clunky process too, which monthly statements can confirm ). See attached. 

Months later, I started receiving collections notices for $ XXXX dollars. Confused, I called XXXX and discussed over the phone the balance, telling them I have a balance of XXXX dollars and that they are mistaken. They told me that the upgrade process had spun off another line of credit for 24 MORE MONTHS (!!! ), some of which was overlapping with the 3-4 month period in which I couldn't send back the old XXXX ( their fault, mind you ). It seemed completely ridiculous. 24 more? Did the first 12 I had paid just .... not count? What is the point of the trade-in then? How could I have paid 16 months of payments ( {$560.00} ), and then be required to pay them another {$900.00}? How much do they think an XXXX costs?? I promise you it's not {$1500.00}. 

I never had visibility into this second line of credit. It was never in my Citizens Bank portal because it hadnt been activated and attached for me to see ( it is now, once I did all the work to figure out what was going on ). I only found out about any of this once I had people hounding me down for money that I still don't think I owe. This whole program is a ridiculous racket.

So actually the XX/XX/XXXX payment is for XX/XX/XXXX Next payment due date IS XX/XX/XXXX I have not sent because my account is not correct Next payment due date IS XX/XX/XXXX I have not seen account is not correct I am not confident that Upgrade is not scamming me because Upgrade took that EXTRA payment in XXXX my account has been showing past due ever since. 

Per the last email received on XX/XX/XXXX After further review, we can confirm the due date change from XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX was completed via the online dashboard on XX/XX/XXXX. 

Why would a XXXX due date be necessary for a FUTURE payment in XXXX. I attached my banking information to Upgrade verifying they never reversed the second payment. 

1. The account needs to be credited correctly 2. My credit report needs to be updated correctly 3. My due date for any of my accounts are NOT for the end of the month.

4. You all have adversely affected my credit score and that has to be rectified.

5. Reverse the payment and give me my money back until this is sorted. 
6. Acknowledge the mistake you all made.

At this point I provided detailed information to resolve this account. My financial institution has given Upgrade all contact information for any further inquiries with verification of Upgrade misappropriation of funds paid to its organization. This has caused damage to my credit status and payment history. 

I have disputed this with XXXX. 
I have attempted to address this amicably with Upgrade directly with detailed records.

I see no further alternatives but to file a complaint about Upgrade Inc. with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the State Attorney General office. 

After speaking with XXXX XXXX XX/XX/XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX 

She reported the treasury department refused to credit {$890.00} from XX/XX/XXXX payment to XX/XX/XXXX payment. She reported this payment was applied to the principal of the loan. She Stated this could not be resolved because it is outside of the window and my account is past due. My account is past due because the account has not been credited correctly. 

XXXX asked if I received an email from Upgrade in XX/XX/XXXX. I informed her I received an email XX/XX/XXXX informing me of an upcoming payment due on XX/XX/XXXX of XXXX. No other email was received. I informed XXXX I did not authorize a due date change from the XXXX to to the XXXX. XXXX was unable to confirm or identify any date that I requested in written, verbal, or chat communication of a due date change to the XXXX. I asked several times if she could find any documentation to that effect and she was not able to. I informed her why would I need a payment to be made to the principal of he loan and not the monthly payment in XX/XX/XXXX. No explanation given. 

Regarding communication I contacted Upgrade immediately in XXXX and XXXX was able to verify the representative I spoke with on XX/XX/XXXX informed me that the double payment was discussed. I requested my payment to be returned because my next due date was not until XX/XX/XXXX. The representative told me I would receive a refund. Throughout the month of XXXX XXXX confirmed Upgrade did not notify me at all the return payment was denied. The entire month of XXXX I was waiting for my money to return to my account. XXXX stated they were not obligated to notify me of the denial of the refund. I contacted Upgrade immediately when I noticed the discrepancy which would have been within the window for the treasury department to take action on this account. But I was never notified of the denial. 

I also asked XXXX why was the payment not just applied to the XXXX payment and she stated it would make my account delinquent. How when the XX/XX/XXXX payment was received prior to XX/XX/XXXX. Then another payment was taken XX/XX/XXXX. 

This is all evidenced by no email notification of a due date change. Also talking on the phone with Upgrade reps appear that lies are told. 

I explained I prefer email. XXXX stated I tried to push my due date back I informed her why would I do that and I do not know how to do that. I confirmed with her that the first and only due date request to change from the XXXX to the XXXX was done speaking with a person. 

At the end she confirmed that Upgrade does not have any verification or confirmation from me to change my due date from the XXXX. I was never told my money would not be returned to me for me to address the payment for XXXX timely. Upgrade refuses to credit my account for XXXX and is now requesting a payment of over {$1900.00} because I havent made a payment because my account is not credited correctly. 

I do not understand at all how someone can arbitrarily change my due date, take two payments, decide that the erroneous second payment can not be credited to the correct month on the account for this to be resolved. However this is a breech of contract when payments are not applied to my account as agreed upon.

06/07/23,"Payday loan, title loan, or personal loan",Installment loan,Problem when making payments,None,"1. I have a personal line of credit with Great American Finance for XXXX XXXX. 

2. The line of credit has two promotional balances with no interest for 18 months. Those promotional balances have to be paid off after 18 months to avoid the interest that is accruing every month. 

3. I have been having difficulty obtaining information or transparency from the company regarding my promotional balances, especially including the interest amounts that are accruing ( and which would be charged after 18 months if the promo bals. are not paid ). 

4. Also, for some reason the company stopped posting my statements online in XXXX XXXX, meaning that neither the XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, nor XXXX statements have posted. 

5. I called and spoke with an agent in customer service apx. one month ago, and was advised promo balance # 1 had a deferred interest amt. of {$270.00} and an promotional period exp. date of XXXX XXXX, XXXX ; and that promo bal # 2 had a deferred interest amt. of {$270.00} and an exp. date of XX/XX/XXXX. 

6. After making my monthly payment, I called back for updated balances on the two promotions ( given that they ought to have both gone down on account of the payment ). The agent *could not* tell me what the updated promo balances were ; nor the updated accrued finance charges. 

7. The agent also confirmed that my statements for the last several months, which were not available online, were also not available to him or to customer service. He requested that those back statements be made available online and to customer service, and that they be mailed to me. 

8. Despite this, they were never mailed to me and they were never placed online or made avail to customer servicer. 

9. Today, after the statement cycled, I called back for the updated promo bals. I was advised by XXXX in Customer Service that promo bal # 1 was {$400.00} ; and promo bal # 2 was {$2200.00}. He said he did not have/ could not provide the updated deferred interest info. It took a lengthy interrogation for him to admit that. He did not even seem to understand how promotional balances worked and I had to explain multiple times what the accrued deferred interest was. 

10. I advised XXXX  that I had previously been able to receive this info but that I wanted an update. I advised him that I had previously been promised that statements would be mailed to me and made available online. 

11. He said he could have a manager call me back, which I requested. He said he could either request the statements be mailed or have a mgr. call me but not both! ( what an outrage, especially after the statements had already been promised to me ). 

12. I explained that I would be filing a CFPB complaint and asked him to advise his supervisor. He said it was my decision to do so, but at first refused to advise the company, asking what good it would do to tell his supervisor? I said that I wanted to notate in the complaint that the company was already aware of the case. After several frustrating rounds in which I asked him yes or no would he advise his supervisor, he finally said yes. 

13. I also said that the company was harming its customers by not being transparent and that they are the ones who stand to profit at the expense of their customers when their customers are hit with accrued deferred interest charges due to a lack of information and transparency to the customer so that they are unable to make informed decisions.

I logged into my Upstart account to see that I still owed XXXX payment. I paid what they said I owed {$82.00}. That would be the remaining {$11.00} for XXXX, XXXX payment of {$56.00} and an additional late fee of {$15.00}. I called Upstart and the representative said they would not remove the late payment reported to the credit bureaus, but that I was now paid ahead by {$11.00}. I advised that does not make sense. The trained representative could not tell what I owed or if I was ahead based off of Upstarts system. The representative then stated their online system does not change for XXXX days. At that point, I already knew I wanted to file a complain, but wanted proof of how Upstarts online system appears to prove my case. Upstart charged me a total of {$45.00} in late fees again as XXXX payment did not post until XX/XX/XXXX. I paid those fees XX/XX/XXXX and my autopay came out XX/XX/XXXX.

I have documentation from the XXXX of my complaint and the person who complained in XXXX, as well as screenshots that show exactly how their online site appears to borrowers. The only thing I wanted was for the late payment to be removed as I was only going by their online system.

08/17/23,"Payday loan, title loan, or personal loan",Installment loan,Problem when making payments,None,"1. I have been having severe, ongoing issues with this company. 

2. There are two promotional balances on this account, with zero percent / eighteen month no interest. I have been experiencing ongoing issues getting accurate information about the two promotional balances, including accrued interest amounts ( pending interest that will be waived if the respective promo bal is paid within the 18 month period ). 

3. Promo balance # 1 currently has a balance of {$220.00}, expiring XX/XX/XXXX. Promo bal # 2 currently has a bl of {$1800.00}, expiring XX/XX/XXXX. 

4. On XX/XX/XXXX, I spoke with XXXX in Customer Service for Great American Finance. She created a plan for me to pay equal payments of {$260.00}, which is greater than the min payment of {$220.00}. I specifically requested for the payments to be applied as follows : {$81.00} towards Promo Balance 1 ; and {$180.00} towards Promo Bal 2. I made a payment for the {$260.00} to be applied accordingly. XXXX said she would forward my request to management. 

5. The company previously wrote in a letter to the CFPB regarding my now-closed complaint : "" When payments are received that are in excess of the minimum monthly payment, the additional funds are distributed equally between both purchases. For example, if an additional {$50.00} is remitted, {$25.00} will be applied to the first purchase and {$25.00} will be applied to the second purchase. If a customer requests that the additional funds be entirely applied to the first purchase, that request will be promptly accommodated. '' 6. However, the company did not apply the payment pursuant to my instructions, according to my calculations. Promo bal 1 came down from {$320.00} to {$220.00}, a reduction of {$99.00}, whereas I had specifically requested that it be reduced by {$81.00}. Promo bal 2 came down from {$200000.00} to {$1800.00}, a reduction of {$160.00}, whereas I had specifically requested that it be reduced by {$180.00}. XXXX could not confirm how my payment was applied ( even though basic math produces the information ). She could not transfer me to a manager. She said she would call me back with the information and that a a manager would call me. 

7. Previously when promised a manager call back from Great American Finance, I have never received one. Nor have a received a call back this time. 

8. I spoke with XXXX at Great American Finance, after calling back. She said the min payment amount of {$220.00} consisted of a min payment of {$77.00} for Promo bal # 1 and a min payment of {$140.00} for Promo bal # 2. Based on my calculations, the company split my overage amount evenly between Promo 1 and 2 ( {$22.00} applied to each above the minimum also applied ). 

9. Therefore, it is clear that despite my request, my hours on the phone, my prior federal complaint, my meticulousness, my proactivity, and my willingness to pay extra, the company failed to follow my request for how my payments by applied. 

10. In conclusion, the company is negligently mishandling payments, refusing to honor customer requests for how payment amounts above the minimum are to be applied to the promotional balances. By refusing to keep its promises and by mishandling customer funds, we customers are left in constant fear of being charged Deferred Interest on the promo balances, no matter how proactive we are, no matter how meticulous we are, and no matter how much we are willing to pay before the promo expiration date.",None,Great American Finance Co,IL,62901,None,Consent provided,Web,08/17/23,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,7419507

XXXX and XXXX were prepared to pay the entire purchase price at the time of their purchase in XXXX and only signed up for the timed payments when XXXX salesperson XXXX XXXX indicated the payment could be made interest-free with equal monthly payments. At no time did XXXX XXXX inform XXXX XXXX XXXX that the loan would incur interest at 29.99 % after a limited promotional period. XXXX XXXX XXXX had only XXXX prior experience with an interest-free loan when they purchased a new XXXX in XXXX. In the case of the auto loan, XXXX XXXX XXXX were told the amount that they were required to pay and the length of time in which it would be paid off. 

In early XX/XX/XXXX Synchrony mailed a credit card to XXXX & XXXX but that card was never activated since they were only interested in the interest-free payment plan on the appliances purchased from XXXX  ( XXXX XXXX : Unused credit card ). 
XXXX called Synchrony to ask when she would receive a statement regarding the loan and was told the first statement would be dated XX/XX/XXXX and would be mailed to her. Following her telephone call XXXX received a paper statement dated XX/XX/XXXX. ( XXXX XXXX : First statement from Synchrony ) The "" Transaction Summary '' of the statement shows amount due and states in uppercase font DEFERRED INTEREST/NO INTEREST IF PAID IN FULL. The Transaction Summary also states in uppercase font INTEREST CHARGE ON PURCHASES {$0.00} XXXX did not read the rest of the statement since the loan had already been described by the XXXX salesperson as interest-free with equal monthly payments. 

The statement provided an online link to set up an autopayment from our bank account. On XX/XX/XXXX XXXX set up the autopayment and received an email confirmation from Synchrony ( XXXX XXXX : Email confirmation of Autopay enrollment ). The confirmation indicates XXXX chose the XXXX XXXX option of {$260.00} monthly. If XXXX made this selection it was done with the belief that the loan was an interest-free loan so long as there was no interruption in the autopayments being deducted from our bank account. 

{$260.00} autopayments were deducted from our XXXX XXXX  account on a monthly basis. 

In early XX/XX/XXXX XXXX asked XXXX for a summary of the autopayments made to Synchrony. When reviewing the summary XXXX & XXXX noticed the cumulative total of the autopayments exceeded the original loan amount of {$7400.00}. The payments at that time totaled {$7800.00}, which was {$390.00} in excess of the original loan amount. ( XXXX XXXX : Autopayments summary reflecting payments through XX/XX/XXXX ) On XX/XX/XXXX XXXX called Synchrony to ask why Synchrony continued to deduct {$260.00} from our checking account after the loan had been repaid in full. ( EX F : XXXX notes from call to Synchrony ). This phone call was the first time we became aware that the interest-free loan was actually incurring 29.99 % interest retroactively to the date we purchased the appliances from XXXX. 

On XX/XX/XXXX XXXX called Synchrony to explain the miscommunication and to request that Synchrony negotiate a settlement based on the loan amount that had already been paid in full. The Synchrony customer service representative refused to discuss a settlement but did admit that Synchrony does not send a notice prior to the end of the promotional period. ( EX G : XXXX notes from call to Synchrony ). 

XXXX & XXXX searched their files for a copy of the XXXX invoice and the Synchrony loan paperwork. They located the invoice ( see XXXX XXXX ) but were unable to locate any Synchrony loan paperwork. If they had received a copy of the Synchrony loan paperwork it would have been in the records they kept for the purchase from XXXX. 

On XX/XX/XXXX XXXX called Synchrony and requested a copy of the signed Synchrony loan paperwork. XXXX was placed on hold for approximately XXXX minutes and then the line was disconnected by Synchrony without any warning. Synchrony never sent a copy of the signed loan paperwork. ( EX H : XXXX notes from call to Synchrony ). 

On XX/XX/XXXX XXXX drove to XXXX and requested a copy of the Synchrony loan paperwork. At that time XXXX was only able to provide a blank sample copy of the Synchrony Application ( EX I : Sample loan application ). At the top of Page ( XXXX ) of the Application it identifies XXXX types of credit promotions and is titled, Types of Credit Promotions That XXXX Be Available. The second type of loan is described as INTEREST FREE AND EQUAL MONTHLY PAYMENTS REQUIRED UNTIL PAID IN FULL ( No Interest ). This is the loan XXXX salesperson XXXX XXXX had described to XXXX & XXXX and they believed they had agreed to. As noted previously, on XX/XX/XXXX XXXX & XXXX were prepared to pay the entire purchase price when they met with XXXX XXXX and only opted for the interest-free loan when he presented it to them. 

On XX/XX/XXXX XXXX emailed XXXX and requested a copy of the Synchrony Bank application XXXX XXXX XXXX submitted to Synchrony with our customer signatures. 

On XX/XX/XXXX XXXX emailed XXXX a signed copy of the Synchrony Application and a Plan Description ( XXXX XXXX : Signed Loan Application + Plan Description ). The Plan Description indicates 18 months DEFERRED/NO INT IF PD IN FULL. The Plan Description does indicate an APR of 29.99 % if the purchase balance is not paid in full but does not indicate what the minimum payment amount must be for the loan to be paid in full in a timely manner. In other words there is no indication that the monthly ACH amount will be {$260.00} and that {$260.00} will be less than the amount needed to pay off the purchase price in 18 months. 

On XX/XX/XXXX XXXX emailed XXXX and asked for an explanation of how the monthly ACH amount was set at {$260.00}. 

On XX/XX/XXXX XXXX emailed XXXX a reply stating, I do not know where {$260.00} came from. But if you signed up for XXXX finance for Synchrony and your total amount purchased, including taxes, was {$7400.00}. You would divide that by XXXX, and your minimum monthly payment would have been {$410.00} to pay it off in full with no interest. I was not present at the time of the purchase. I can't speculate about the conversation you had with XXXX. But you requested your signed paperwork which I have provided for you. 

On XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX called Synchrony again to request that they have an opportunity to speak with someone about negotiating a settlement based on the loan amount that had already been paid in full. XXXX & XXXX were then transferred to XXXX, a XXXX who confirmed Synchrony will not negotiate a settlement. When XXXX asked XXXX to explain who determines that the monthly payment amount would be {$260.00}, XXXX admitted Synchrony makes that determination. Moments later the call was disconnected without warning by Synchrony. ( see XXXX XXXX, lower portion of exhibit ). The tone of the conversation with XXXX was at all times polite and this can be confirmed by the recording Synchrony made of the call. 

Summary : XXXX. XXXX and XXXX were prepared to pay the full XXXX invoice on their existing credit card at the time of the purchase XXXX. The XXXX salesperson indicated the payment could be made interest-free with equal monthly payments through a Synchrony loan XXXX. The XXXX salesperson never indicated the loan would incur 29.99 % interest at the end of a promotional period that would be set by Synchrony XXXX. An autopayment plan was set up by XXXX without disclosure to her that $ XXXX XXXX payments would trigger a retroactive 29.99 % interest charge at the end of a promotional period. 
XXXX. XXXX did not receive clear communication from Synchrony prior to the end of the promotional period. 
XXXX. Because the monthly payments occurred automatically, until their XX/XX/XXXX conversation with Synchrony, XXXX and XXXX were not aware that the payments had exceeded the {$7400.00} loan amount. As of XX/XX/XXXX XXXX and XXXX have paid {$650.00} in interest and owe {$3900.00} in additional interest. 
XXXX. Multiple efforts to resolve this with Synchrony have resulted in Synchrony customer service personnel refusing to negotiate a settlement and ultimately disconnecting the calls without provocation or warning.

I cried to her and asked if there was anything that she could do to even get a portion of it back and then we can set up monthly payments. I asked for any solution, any leeway. She did not empathize towards my situation at all or have any solutions. She was cold and kept repeating herself and told me it was my fault, Im responsible for the loan, and if I wouldve contacted Navy Federal before they took the money, then they could have helped me.

The transaction was for XXXX XXXX XXXX advertised as being authentic instruments. XXXX XXXX ID : XXXX. 

XX/XX/XXXX - XX/XX/XXXX : The instruments were received within the month of XXXX, upon which they were taken to a local authorized XXXX dealer for a preliminary set up service. Upon the date of inspection for inventory, they were determined as counterfeit instruments and consequently denied service. This is when I first learned that what I bought was a cheap, counterfeit forgery. 

XX/XX/XXXX : The dispute process was initiated through the PayPal Resolution Center, typically the first line of defense with regards to buyer protection as outlined in PayPal 's Purchase Protection terms. Upon my phone conversation with the representative I was informed that the only method they would consider offering that would involve me being issued a return refund, was to ship the counterfeit items back overseas to XXXX. Given the potential for illegality involved with the shipment of counterfeit goods, especially overseas, I was very hesitant to pursue this option. However, I made it known that I was willing to determine shipping rates as we were on the phone conversation, though it became quickly apparent that there were no shipping rates that would make any fiscal sense in returning the items. I would effectively be left hundreds of dollars short in my bank account due to the ratio of the shipping rates to respective refund for the items, and still left without the promised goods that initiated my purchase in the first place. I was told that this was the only avenue I was able to pursue in getting a refund, despite PayPal 's Buyer Protection terms outlining multiple clauses ; the least of which states that buyers are in fact protected against receiving inauthentic items in transactions made through the PayPal platform. 

XX/XX/XXXX : Eventually I was able to speak to a customer service representative through the respective PayPal Credit customer service line, who informed me that I would in fact be able to receive a refund after offering multiple solutions. The main one being that I would be willing and able to return the counterfeit items, despite any personal qualms with potential illegality, to the sellers if they were to cover the whole cost of return shipping. I agreed to this proposed solution and was thus issued a full refund back to my PayPal Credit account of {$540.00}. 

XX/XX/XXXX : With the intent to continue using my PayPal Credit account, despite having yet to hear back from either seller or customer service representative with regards to return shipping, I spoke with a customer service chat representative through the PayPal Credit customer service portal and inquired if the chargeback was officially closed in my favor, so as to put off any worries of my credit limit being surpassed due to the nature of the charge potentially being reversed. I was assured that the case was already closed in my favor. Considering I had no further use for any of the counterfeit instruments due to the case being closed and having no interest in keeping evidence of importing counterfeit goods with my legal name tied to the transaction, I simply had them destroyed at a local waste management service. 

XX/XX/XXXX : Today I noticed that on XX/XX/XXXX, the full {$540.00} charge was reapplied to my PayPal Credit account. I immediately called the customer service line to inquire as to the nature of the reversal. I was informed that the offer notwithstanding was not able to be followed through with and further that the charge will stand. As of this date I have NEVER received in writing any clear explanation for why the charge was reversed again after being issued the credit and having it confirmed by a representative that the dispute was closed in my favor, I have NOT received any communication from the seller nor PayPal with regards to the fulfillment of the proposed seller-provided return shipping labels, and I am now left without any products to return after believing that I settled the issue once and for all.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,SYNCHRONY FINANCIAL,TX,77023,None,Consent provided,Web,03/12/23,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,6684248

I contacted customer service of Always Money about the issue and was told that payment arrangements were to be made according to a predetermined date of the XXXX ( XXXX ) of each month and was established as the repayment date beyond the control of the loan officer who completed the loan, and not be permanently changed to the XXXX ( XXXX  ) of each month as I had requested. I reviewed the details of the loan agreement ( which I had now received by e-mail and saw that the XXXX ( XXXX ) of each month had in fact been established by the loan agreement. I was also told that I could ONLY make payment without penalty on the XXXX XXXX XXXX ) of each month if I called each month prior to the XXXX  ( XXXX ) of each month and formerly requested the change. I consented that I understood and for a month or two I made the calls to request the changed due dates and had no issues. 
However, as if in an effort to further complicate matters, the next payment was deducted ( in XX/XX/XXXX ) on the first ( 1st ) of the following month, which caused my account to be overdrawn and a flow of overdrafts amounting to {$260.00} and an isolated charge from Always Money for {$38.00}, which I have been unable to get an explanation for even after l attempts to file a complaint with the Complaint Department on Always Money ( which I now understand has recently been *bought out* by XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX 
I have had my bank to issue to me a new Debt Card ( in XX/XX/XXXX ) to change my account information shared with Always Money so they could not receive payments by ACH any longer, and in XX/XX/XXXX I began to make payments by personal check directly to the office when I initially completed the loan agreement. 
As of XXXX of XXXX, Always Money has been able to gain access to my account and extract the monthly payment prior to my making payment by personal check, even though I have changed my account details which I had given them access to. 
The terms of the agreement were that I would accept the {$2100.00} loan to be paid in full after a period of six ( 6 ) months at an APR of 156.23 %. Obviously Always Money has made every effort to extend the length of the loan agreement in an effort to ensure that they are able to collect what would amount to {$4500.00} PLUS the original loan amount of {$2100.00}. 
I would like to add that I have been harassed from the beginning of this loan about making payments early, with multiple calls from employees of Always Money, even before my first payment became due. All this even though had never missed a payment over a period of 11 ( eleven ) months, and when I was able initially to contact them for reasonable explanations for certain discrepancies, I was told in a quote "" All I care about is my paycheck ''! 
Fully frustrated by the conditions of this loan relationship and after contacting the Alabama Attorney General 's Office, I realized that this loan arrangement I am describing falls under the restrictions existing in the State of Alabama where there is a limit of 17 % interest rate ( well exceeded by this loan with Always Money, regardless of their demanded APR repayment rate percentage )",None,"Triton Management Group, Inc",AL,36116,Older American,Consent provided,Web,04/17/23,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,6853365

On XX/XX/XXXX, their website stated the "" today 's payoff '' balance of my loan was {$5000.00}. There was no indication of additional interest or fees. There was an asterisk next to the amount but it only stated that I needed to call the local branch to obtain a payoff balance for a future date. 

I paid the "" today 's payoff '' balance in full on XX/XX/XXXX and received a final confirmation message on their website that "" Your payment of : {$5000.00} has been applied to your account. '' I interpreted this to mean my account was now fully paid off. 

I later found that my loan wasn't paid off I'm accruing interest on the interest. The first time I spoke to them about the balance, I believe I owed them around {$100.00}. I told them that I paid the full payoff balance on their website and was told that they would investigate. 

The interest continued to compound over time and I hadn't heard back so I reached back out and spoke to someone at my local branch. I provided them with screenshots I had taken for my own records showing the "" today 's payoff amount, '' my payment being made, and the confirmation page. Even with the proof that I paid the full balance, they stated they couldn't waive any of the remaining balance and I now owe them over {$130.00} if I want to close the account. 

I did pay the remaining balance today and received an email from the agent at the local branch as confirmation that is now paid off ; however, this whole ordeal felt very predatory and I'm grateful I had funds to pay off the balance so it didn't impact my credit score.

I'll start by providing the first complaint number which is XXXX. I believe that was submitted in XXXX XXXX. 
I was hoping that by doing so I would've received my title back since by this point I had paid the loan amount back multiple times over.. 
To my dismay, title max wasn't going to let my title go that easy.. 
After submitting the previous complaint, I patiently waited for a response from title max and a proposal of what could/would need to be done in order to obtain my title. 
They verbally informed me what the agreement would consist of but to this day they have yet to give me a physical copy of anything. I vaguely remember the terms of the agreement, as I can not recall exact dollar amounts or dates. I requested a copy of the new agreement multiple times as well as some sort of receipt showing all of my previous payments made. When I went into my local office to make the first payment I again asked for a copy of these documents. I was told they would get them to me as soon as possible. I was sure to leave my wife 's phone number with them as my primary contact number as my phone was getting shut off so I could be contacted as soon as these documents were to be available. 
I couldn't even tell you the exact date and payment amount that I made because I was never given a substantial receipt, as the amount on the "" receipt '' they provided at the time does not have this information. 
I was under the impression I had up to but no longer than 6 months to pay the new dollar amount in either one lump sum payment or in three payments. I decided three payments would be the best option. Now I had hoped to have all three payments made in a short period of time, in order to get my title back and just be done with all of this.. ideally 30-60 days but if I was unable to do so I was under the impression it was not required to have all three payments made in this time span, again I was thinking I had 6 months. 
37 days after making my first payment my truck was repossessed without any type of warning. Never was I contacted by TitleMax, never did they give me the documents I requested multiple times over. Now after contacting them today to try and figure out and understand what the heck just happened I am informed I will have to pay {$790.00} to get my truck back and an additional {$2000.00} something dollars to get my title. They said our previous agreement made after filing the previous complaint is now void because I didn't hold up my end of the bargain. Well since I was never given a physical copy of this agreement/contract and was never notified by phone, mail, email or any other way I didn't realize I was breaking any agreements. I asked them why I was never contacted and their answer to that was they were unable to contact me because I was in legal. After asking what exactly that meant multiple times I still couldn't tell you because they refused to give me this information. Instead they gave me a phone number to call. This phone number was for a different part of their company or something who in turn just transferred me back to my local office.

I am writing to you today in hopes of resolving a critical issue I am currently facing with a financial institution, Grain. Their recent action, or rather lack thereof, has negatively impacted my financial profile, and I am finding it difficult to rectify this situation without your valuable assistance. 

Several months ago, I had a charge-off on my account with Grain. After numerous discussions and negotiations, we mutually agreed that upon receipt of my payment, they would delete this charge-off from my credit profiles. I promptly made the payment as agreed and was under the impression that this matter was resolved. 

However, I was recently made aware that this charge-off remains on my credit reports. Despite my numerous attempts to communicate with Grain and sort out this issue, I have been met with unresponsiveness and a lack of cooperation. This is causing significant strain on my personal finances and overall credit health, as the presence of the charge-off continues to negatively impact my credit score.

I kindly request the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau 's help in this matter. I am seeking your intervention to compel Grain to honor our agreement and remove the charge-off from my credit profiles. I have attached all relevant documents, including our agreement and proof of payment. 

I understand the Bureau 's commitment to ensuring fair treatment for consumers in the financial marketplace. As such, I am hopeful that with your intervention, this matter can be resolved promptly and fairly.

06/08/23,"Payday loan, title loan, or personal loan",Title loan,Charged fees or interest you didn't expect,None,"I am raising this concern because I have a Loan secured through my Vehicle Title through TitleMax/TMX. As the consumer and natural living person I have the right to be treated fair and equitable during and after all Consumer Credit Transactions as well as notified in the open and conspicuously about rates, disclosures, fees, contractual agreements etc prior to a contract for it to be considered binding. I recently went to check on the status of my loan repayment and discovered that after almost a year I am nowhere near paying off the actual loan. Most payments have been heftily applied to alleged handling fees and interest. Only a meniscal amount has been applied to the principal. I was not alerted of this until my recent self discovery. When I went to get the loan in XXXX of XXXX my social security number was ran but apparently my loan was secured through my vehicle title only. The entire application was done on large computers by the representative. I received all of the paperwork in an envelope once I was everything was already completed and I was ready to walk out of the door. No one in the store went over these rates and disclosures with me in full detail. Everyone made it seem like they were doing me a favor and acting in good faith. However I now know that I have been manipulated and possibly frauded in the process. I only received {$650.00} when the loan originated in XXXX of XXXX. Why is the current payoff amount over {$350.00} in XXXX after 9 months of {$120.00} payments? These rates are ridiculously high and their practices from a consumers prospective is very deceptive and unfair to say the least. If they do not disclose these facts prior to doing business, how is that fair and equitable? They take advantage of already vulnerable people is morally and logically wrong. However all they care about is money and taking your vehicle in the event you are not able to make one of these outrageous payments. I would like for The CFPB to investigate TMX rates, disclosure policies, and overall business practices, to make sure they are in compliance with my state. After I discovered my rates I researched the company 's history a little more and found out that this company has a history of willful noncompliance and deceptive business practices. I have located over 200 Consumer complaints, XXXX XXXX XXXX complaints, Court Filings, countless forums online, and many consumers warning others to never do business with them. They even have a history of scamming military servicemen. This company is very shady. I even saw a press release from XX/XX/XXXX with a gentleman alleging the same exact thing to him at a store in Georgia. After he blew the whistle, TMX allegedly gave him his title back and said the loan was satisfied. That reaction alone lets me know that obviously they know this is happening but it is very apparent that they do not care! As a consumer, I believe that I have a right to fair and transparent financial services, and I am disappointed that TitleMax has failed to meet these basic standards of The Truth In Lending Act. I am also concerned that other consumers may be similarly affected by TitleMax 's illegal and unethical practices. Therefore, I request that the Consumer Financial Protection investigate TitleMax 's business practices and take appropriate enforcement action, including imposing fines and penalties and requiring TitleMax to provide monetary restitution.",None,TMX Finance LLC,MS,39206,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,06/08/23,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,7086504
06/22/23,"Payday loan, title loan, or personal loan",Payday loan,Can't stop withdrawals from your bank account,None,"On XXXX. XXXX, 2023 I received an email from Explore Credit saying I was approved for {$1000.00}. I ignored it as spam as I get those a lot and know to never click links. Then I started getting voice mails and text messages ; also not uncommon. When they didn't stop I copied the URL to the website and using their log-in instructions, found a loan document in my name, complete with old bank account information -- the bank account is still active but I barely use it and haven't in years because the nearest branch is over XXXX hours away from me. I never applied for a loan with this company. I scrolled through the application and saw it was a payday company. I never signed. Then I started getting messages to verify my bank account so they could see my balances by linking them to it electronically. I NEVER do that except with reputable companies, government agencies or other banks. I closed the website and ignored it all. 

The next day ( XXXX. XXXX ) I got another email saying to check my bank account. I ignored it. Then, on XX/XX/XXXX I got a overdraw notice from my bank. I checked my account and they had tried to withdraw a payment for {$300.00} and change. I didn't have that in my account so my bank refused but charged me {$24.00}. I immediately emailed customer service ( at the email I provided in this complaint ) and was told that I applied for a loan. I said I did not. The next response they admitted I hadn't : "" you're right you didn't apply with us but we got your information. '' How is that okay? They just somehow hacked my personal information, put it in a loan application and somehow got access to my bank account? 

Then, they said that I did "" e-sign '' the application and sent me a copy, with my electronic "" signature '' on XXXX. XXXX. I did not sign anything, I just scrolled through portions of the document, not even the entire thing. 

Since they, I have repeatedly asked them to quit attempting withdrawals, told them they had no authorization or consent. They kept repeating that an email with that request in writing wasn't "" acceptable '' as part of their process. That is not my understanding of the law. I have very poor cell phone service out where I live and I was not going to call someone I never initiated contact with in the first place and that was likely scamming me. I also reminded them that I never did any electronic or online bank verification process. Then they later told me ( again, via email ) they'd only stop withdrawal attempts if I sent them 3 months of bank statements. I told them I wasn't going to send bank statements to a random individual from an organization I'd never heard of before. 

So far they have tried to withdraw payments 8 times, resulting in over {$200.00} in overdraft fees TO ME. I've put in a fraud complaint to my bank but they said they may not be able to do anything since they had my bank account info, that it was easier for them to do if it was through the debit card -- which doesn't make sense to me. 

Right now I don't know what to do except close this bank account, which I've had for over 10 years and don't want to do, especially since I'll have to make up the over {$200.00} in overdraft fees Explore Credit has caused. 

I am attaching the "" loan agreement '' they sent me that they said I signed- all it has is a typed name on the bottom ; I never signed anything, and it even says at the top of the document that underwriting needs to verify and approve everything - I did not connect my bank to them for verification which in a separate email to me they said was required.

08/08/23,"Payday loan, title loan, or personal loan",Personal line of credit,Charged fees or interest you didn't expect,None,"The complaint I am filing with CFPB is with GreenSky. In order to describe this thoroughly, I need to also mention the involvement of XXXX XXXX XXXX. 

I hired XXXX XXXX XXXX to replace all the windows in my home, and decided to finance this project via GreenSky due to the promotional rate GreenSky was offering. After the windows were installed, I noticed that some of the windows were missing window stoppers. I reached out several times to XXXX to have them finish the installation and supply the window stoppers, but I was unsuccessful in getting XXXX to comply. 

Per GreenSkys Customer Bill of Rights, I filed a dispute with GreenSky regarding the window stoppers that Power never installed. GreenSky credited my account on XX/XX/2023 with a provisional credit of {$2200.00}, According to GreenSkys policy, this credit can be removed if XXXX ever completed the installation. It is important to note that XXXX never completed the installation, never supplied me with the correct window stoppers and never contacted me again after my last email exchange with them on XX/XX/2023. 

GreenSky subsequently sent me a letter dated XX/XX/2023, which is a week after they credited my account with the provisional credit. This letter states that as a result of their investigation of my dispute, The provisional credit previously applied to your account will now become permanent. This means that the {$2200.00} credit I received is now permanent and I am no longer responsible for paying it. 

On XX/XX/2023, I called and spoke with DeCarlos, a Customer Solutions Account Manager at GreenSky, XXXX ext. XXXX, to follow up with GreenSky about my dispute with XXXX. In this conversation I notified XXXX that XXXX had still not supplied the window stoppers. XXXX reviewed my account information, saw the aforementioned letter in my account and verified the credit to my account was permanent. At this point, I communicated to XXXX that I decided not to bother pursuing XXXX anymore to rectify the situation since the credit was permanent. I would just live with not having the correct window stoppers. As I stated earlier, XXXX has still not supplied the window stoppers and never contacted me again to complete the project. 

I made the minimum payments on time for the statement periods ending XX/XX/2023 and XX/XX/2023, respectively. At this point, my payoff ( remaining ) balance is now {$19000.00}, and this dollar amount includes the permanent credit of {$2200.00} previously applied to my account. 

I paid off the remaining balance on XX/XX/2023, XXXX day before the due date of XX/XX/2023. I received an email from GreenSky acknowledging receipt of that payment. At this point, I have completely paid off the loan. 

Much to my surprise, once I paid off the loan, GreenSky sent me another statement for the period ending XX/XX/2023, saying I still have a balance. This statement shows I submitted the aforementioned payment of {$19000.00}, although it lists the date incorrectly as XX/XX/2023 ( a minor detail ). Without communicating anything to me, either through email, snail mail, or a phone call, GreenSky removed the permanent credit of {$2200.00}. 

I called GreenSky to inquire about their error on XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX and several times on XX/XX/XXXX. During one of these calls, I came to find out that XXXX told GreenSky on XX/XX/2023 that they ( XXXX ) completed the project, which is completely false. This led to GreenSky reversing the credit, however, the credit was deemed permanent! It seems GreenSky needs a review of basic vocabulary as to the definition of the word permanent. In addition, GreenSky never reached out to me to inquire if the project was in fact completed, which it was not. 

For the calls made on XX/XX/XXXX and XXXX, I was able to speak with XXXX again both times. During those calls, I specifically asked for an email correspondence rather than phone calls due to my work schedule. XXXX assured me he would follow up with me one way or another and would initiate an email correspondence. However, I have never heard back from anyone at GreenSky to provide an update or rectify this issue, be it a phone call, voice mail or email, hence my subsequent calls on XX/XX/XXXX and XXXX. I have checked my Junk email folder and made sure my phone had space to receive voice mails, so I know GreenSky has not contacted me regarding this issue. The only correspondence I have received are XXXX subsequent statements and collection notices claiming my account is past due, which is false. 

My credit scores from all three rating agencies have consistently been near or above XXXX, which is an indication of my financial character to pay my bills and keep accurate records. I have also since learned that XXXX XXXX, the parent company of GreenSky, is suffering major loses due to its acquisition of GreenSky and is trying to sell GreenSky. It turns out that GreenSky has never turned a profit and losses have reportedly amounted to over {$3.00} XXXX ( XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXgreensky/ ). What is more likely, a person with my track record suddenly deciding not to pay his bills or a company that is having financial issues doing whatever they can to diminish their losses. 

I have not bothered trying to contact GreenSky again because it is obvious to me that GreenSky is not operating in good faith and is not conducting good business practices. They refuse to acknowledge their mistake and quite possibly are doing so due to their financial difficulties. The {$2200.00} credit should never have been removed from my account for either of the following reasons : I still have not received the window stoppers but more importantly, GreenSky sent me a letter ( a legal document ) deeming the credit permanent.",None,GOLDMAN SACHS BANK USA,NY,11010,None,Consent provided,Web,08/08/23,Closed with non-monetary relief,Yes,N/A,7368843

While we were surprised at the high installation cost vs. product cost, we decided to proceed as we could see the overall benefits of having solar energy collection. Our interest rate was 1.99 % over a 25 year term, which we found favorable. After 10 months of {$230.00} per month payments, I checked on the website to see what our new principal amount was, as I wanted to consider paying off my debt.

I reached out via email, and was provided an answer that my rate is distributed daily, equalling {$4.00} per day. Basically what they are doing is front loading the interest, which decreases according to the remaining principal. So out of a {$230.00} payment, less than half was being applied to my principal!

05/10/23,"Payday loan, title loan, or personal loan",Title loan,Vehicle was repossessed or sold the vehicle,None,"Title Max title loan dispute complaint and possible court case.

On XXXX XXXX XXXX I was going out to my car to go spend time with my daughter and granddaughter. When I went outside Iiimediately noticed my car was gone I was quite upset because I couldnt believe that Title Max had actually taken my car. So I will tell you about the loan on XX/XX/XXXX. I went to Title Max to get a loan. I told the loan agent that I only wanted to borrow XXXXXXXX  to pay my car insurance and that I couldnt afford to make payments that were above XXXXXXXX    a month. I also told him that my credit was very bad and they were probably not likely to approve me for a loan. I dont know why he tried to get as much as possible or as much is XXXX   for me to be approved to borrow .  I dont know.  I didnt ask him to do that,. possibly because he had went out and took a look at my car and started it up and so I guess he thought he could get as much as XXXX approved   When I took the loan out I fully had every intention of paying the loan back. I did not plan on losing my car, in fact, I used part of the loan to make the first two payments to Title Max for a total of XXXX .  I also I dont feel like they were honest about figuring out my ability to be repay the loan.  Isnt that the law ?  So based only on my income (and that was the only document t; that I provided and that was asked for) I showed him my Social Security benefit letter, saying how much I get each month .  Social Security is my only income and it also states that I am XXXX  so he knew that this was my only income and the only other thing he asked me was how much my rent was which I told them it was XXXXXXXX  .  Everything I told him was the truth.  anyway when he said I was approved for XXXX  Ii told hime I didnt want to borrow that much.  He proceeded to tell me a little story about some people who came in to get a loan and they didnt borrow the full amount they were approved for and then the next week they called back and wanted to borrow the rest of what they were approved for and that he had to tell them to do it. They would have to start the whole process over again and see what happened and  they might not even get approved . he was trying to talk me into borrowing a bigger amountt than I requested or wanted.  To me that seems very predatory. So I thought well if Im going to give up my car title then I might as well take whatever they give me ( i knew I couldnt get credit any other way) . I knew I could hang onto some of the cash to make the first two payments (XXXX   and XXXX) and then my plan was in XXXX. I was supposed to move in with my daughter and that would lower my monthly expenses of rent utilities down to XXXXXXXX  a month which wouldve allowed me to make the payments to Title Max I did not commit fraud. I fully intended to pay the loan back; to repay the loan. My daughter changed her mind about me moving in and then in XXXX I had no choice but to start paying the XXXX dollars a month that my apartments had raised my rent to.
so there was no way I could make the XXXX payments each month and still be able to pay my rent and my bills and my medical costs .  There was just no way.  so in XXXX I mailed title max a letter explaining the situation and saying that I couldnt afford XXXX payment . they didnt respond so then I looked through the contract and I wanted to go about it right so I sent them the dispute letter (as it tells to do in the contract ) and they didnt respond for quite a long long time and when they did, they argued it with me in the letter and they didnt offer arbitration or anything,.  I just didnt know what to do. During this time I had been in contact with XXXX XXXX XXXX, and I was attempting to get help in knowing what to do but they decided not to help me. I called XXXX XXXX XXXX and they said they couldnt help me. I didnt know what to do!
Then on XXXX XXXX I received a text from Title Max saying we have a great offer for you for a repayment plan. It said call this number or text  yes to get more info or something. I still have the texts so I replied yes and very next day they just came and took the car, I am a XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX , and a XXXXXXXX  Patient and XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX and I seriously feel like I was really treated wrongly. I feel like TitleMax is allowed to continue to break the laws and they use decpeptive and unfair business methods.  basically I dont understand the laws Im trying to read them and I thought there was things that Title Max was doing wrong that they shouldve done differently.  like they shouldve analyzed my ability to repay ; but they didnt and they also said my credit score was XXXX  but it isnt so it never has been. Its XXXX so they lied about that, they didnt ask me about any of my other bills or my medical expenses or anything they didnt ask to see i 
 
Bank statements or any utility bills or anything like that so I dont see how they fulfilled that part  of the NRS and federal legal lending laws. also when we were going through the contract or whatever I didnt have the paper pages in front of me,  he didnt print out the contract for me to see it. I was just listening to him and signing my name on this little electronic pad so I dont think Ive ever actually signed a piece of paper. He didnt give me the printed contract until after it was all over with as I was leaving so I didnt even know I was signing an affidavit of ability to repay and I didnt understand the contract, and it wasnt very well explained to me and I feel it is actually very deceptive and predatory and aside from that my understanding was that the payments werent supposed to be more than 25% of my income and I attempted to state this to them and i  also told them that my car should be exempt from lien or judgment because of the Social Security act and but that I still intended to repay the loan, I just was trying to get them not to come and get my car .  they did anyway .and then the repayment plan they offered me. Seemed wrong.  i was under the impression that ithe terms were supposed to be at a lower interest-rate . so on Friday the XXXX they took my car without any kind of notice or warning. Then yesterday I received a letter in the mail and now theyre adding all sorts of fees and saying that ii owe the original amount plus much more to get my car back.  I dont think it was right for them to be able to take my car at all, IIjust feel like there was no Consumer projection, and there should be protection against that kind of business that takes advantage of people and that doesnt follow the law or fairness or integrity in lending and I cant believe they came and got my girl I already re paid them almost XXXX of the XXXX that I had borrowed .  the car has XXXXXXXX miles. And needs work. And the letter stated if they dont get enough from the sale of my car that i still will owe them

I also have been going through some very serious health problems that negatively affect my daily life and my mood and my abilities-  the financial stress is making me weaker and sicker .  I feel disrespected and taken advantage of.  I feel discriminated against for my XXXX and my age

I've been taking screenshots of each payment I make, and what it says my new amount to pay loan off is at that time, as well as the amount due for my next payment the following month. ( It never ever goes down, always up higher )! I've literally already paid my original loan off, plus the interest, and have paid way above my monthly amount due each month. I owe now more than the original 6 month loan I applied for, ( that's what they assured me I was getting ), and that's after on time payments every month, was not supposed to be for eternity, but for only 6 months or less.. 

TitleMax knew I'd just had a XXXX, and was just out of the hospital the day before I drove to XXXX office and got the loan. They knew that I am 100 % XXXX, that I'm in the middle of XXXX treatment, and I am XXXX desperate need of gas money for my treatment, and now all postponed. XXXX multiplies with stress, and I feel that I've intentionally been targeted, and then scammed. I owned my XXXX  with a clear blue title that I was so proud of. My loan was for gas cost, and medical expenses so I could continue treatment that's hours away from where I live. It's horrible the nightmares I've been having, this kind of stuff should be illegal! I need help, please! 
During the application process, they wouldn't let me see their computer screen, saying to me that the font on screen would be too small for me to read. She said that she'd go over all that was on her screen so, as if she were helping me, then I could just initial, and sign. I asked her several times to confirm that as long as I pay 6 months on time, that I'd get my title back upon the last payment, and that if I was able to pay even XXXX or more above payment amount as she said, thatit would be paid in full in 5 months, and she said yes, that's correct. I believed her, and thought she was a very kind, and honest person. She proved me very wrong though, she's a con artist taught by her superiors how to use smoke & mirrors to con people like me. % hats so wrong, and punishment should be put in place. From stories I just read, they've been doing this forever, and getting away with it. I need to understand why it's ok to do this, when courts say it's wrong. They are breaking the law, and have caused horrific pain, and much damage to people 's lives, and their mental health, not to mention how many people have had suicidal ideation because they know no way of how to pay off a loan for something that was theirs to begin with, and have paid over and over again until they can't go on any further. 
My XXXX treatments are on hold, because I don't even have enough money for gas to get to appointments at all after paying off my 6 months and interest to total full amount, I was told that would be all I'd have to pay, but am now paying it all over and over again leaving me penniless. My electric was getting cut off the other day and I went for help from the county where I live. They paid enough to keep lights on, and a {$25.00} gas voucher.As of today I'm right back XXXX same situation after just getting paid yesterday. 

I'm XXXX XXXX I feel alone with no help, and see no end in sight. I have only my XXXX sons and no family. TitleMax says if I don't continue to pay, that they will take my only transportation, and I live in a rural area with no public transportation. I'm scared to death that when I took out that loan, I signed a death wish for myself. And it is so disturbing to know that this lady at TitleMax took advantage of me knowing my situation, and that I have XXXX, as well as on XXXX that provides me a very limited income each month.And they are literally trained to do this to every single customer nationwide. I have faith in the justice system, but we need someone to advocate for us, we need new laws in place that will prevent this type of thievery from companies like TitleMax! They can't keep getting away this! Please help me, I just want my XXXX title that I own, the loans never going to get paid off at 300 plus % interest rates, the principal never gets money added to it, because some lie they tell us about the loan process, and never saying to us that we have to take a new loan out every month. This is so insane!

So yes, any help you can be assisting me with learning my rights here in Texas, would be very much appreciated. I'm at wits end and just don't know what to do, and TitleMax has no empathy or compassion with what Im going through with my health. This is so so wrong, and should be 100 % illegal what Titlemax is doing not just to me, but to everyone that walks in to get a loan with them, and instead is sold a bunch of lies that they make them huge huge profit, while the borrower sits and contemplates ways to make it stop, hurting themselves, or completely losing their minds to this abuse by the scam that TitleMax teaches each employees, not caring the damage done to all the lives they've ripped through like a cat 5 tornado leaving the borrower with nothing but more wreckage to clean up alone, more than they've ever had to deal with in life.

Excuse my rambling on, but I "" cry myself to sleep every night, I am so depressed that I never even leave the house, I can't even afford to leave, or even eat a healthy meal.

I had given up hope of anyone helping me understand, and then I read the headlines on yet another complaint filed against TitleMax, and was hopeful that I may find some answers to my situation, and how I should handle it, and possibly get this paid loans weight off my shoulders.

To see that so many others are going through the exact same problem with TitleMax, and to see that there's companies out here like yourself that protect consumers from these scam artist, who are only out to rip consumers off, while making huge profits, it really gave me hope today, for a solution here.Being on 100 % XXXX, with a set income, people like me can not afford to hire an attorney to help us, and TitleMax preys on us because they know that XXXX, and the XXXX  persons usually do not have that kind of money and can't do anything about it when being ripped off. 


Thank you! What y'all do to help protect consumers is greatly appreciated!

I have paid off several loans and kept a high balance for many years with them. However, I have been repeatedly denied credit. My score has never improved after I paid off loans from them and yet they used my credit score to deny me credit on several occasions the last time was XX/XX/2023, on approximately the XXXX. At that time they said they checked XXXX and that my score was too low to approve me. That is incorrect. My XXXX score at that time was XXXX. I am being denied credit illegally, forcing me to have a lower credit score than I have earned, causing me severe emotional stress, family distress and unnecessary hardship. They have consistently violated my access to credit and cause my credit score to be lowered even further when they run my credit and refuse me access to funding. This is clearly discrimination and according to your organization, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, denying me credit is discrimination. Under 12 CFR 202.4-Discrimination A creditor shall not discriminate against an applicant on a prohibited basis regarding any aspect of a credit transaction. 

The definition of discriminate according to CFPB : Discriminate against an applicant means to treat an applicant less favorably than other applicants.

I am deeply disappointed and frustrated with their actions, which have caused financial strain and compromised my safety. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I applied for a loan with OneMain Financial through their online platform. At the time of application, I was not informed about the exorbitant interest rate that would be charged on the loan. This lack of transparency is both unfair and deceptive, as it prevented me from making an informed decision about entering into this loan agreement. 

Furthermore, I would like to bring to your attention the manner in which OneMain Financial has been contacting me. Despite my repeated requests to cease contacting me while I am driving, their representatives continue to call me incessantly, which poses a serious risk to my safety. In one instance, I received a call while I was driving, and the distraction nearly caused an accident. This disregard for my safety is unacceptable and should not be tolerated. 

In addition to the interest rate discrepancy and the incessant phone calls, I would like to highlight the fact that the loan in question was secured by the title of my vehicle. This collateral arrangement has further added to my distress and XXXX. It is deeply concerning to think that OneMain Financial has the power to repossess my vehicle if I am unable to meet their unreasonably high payment demands. 

I believe that OneMain Financial 's practices are not only unethical but also violate the principles of fair lending and consumer protection. I kindly request the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to thoroughly investigate this matter and take appropriate action against OneMain Financial to ensure that other consumers are not subjected to the same mistreatment. 

I trust in the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau 's commitment to safeguarding consumers ' rights and ensuring a fair and transparent financial marketplace. I appreciate your attention to this matter and look forward to a prompt resolution.

I presume our email addresses are similar. I am not, nor have I ever been, a client of this company. 

I have twice called this company to tell them that they are using an incorrect email address and that I am receiving notices intended for their client. These emails divulge the amount of the loans, the amount of the monthly payments, the length of the loans, the loan account number, the name of client 's bank from which the payment will be drawn, and the last four numbers of the bank account from which the payment will be drawn.

Despite my twice letting the company know in telephone conversations that it is divulging sensitive information to someone who has no right to it, they have not addressed this issue. It may be that their client and I have similar email addresses, but the address should have been verified before they began using it. Clearly they did not.

I am concerned that this company, UPSTART, is not taking appropriate care with its clients ' information. I know far more about this stranger and her financial dealings than I should.

04/15/23,"Payday loan, title loan, or personal loan",Installment loan,Struggling to pay your loan,None,"On XX/XX/XXXXXXXX Santander Consumer USA had a tow company attempt to STEAL my XXXX XXXX XXXX for the 2nd time. In this 2nd attempt, the tow truck company ( name unknown at the moment ) breached the peace, creating a very hostile situation. The woman that was assisting the tow truck driver illegally entered my vehicle attempting to block me from getting in my driver 's seat. 

Which led to a physical altercation. An absolute violation of law and a breach of contract. I verbally stated that they "" may not take my car ''. I asked the woman repeatedly to remove herself from the vehicle to which she refused until I was able to physically force my way into the driver 's seat and start my vehicle. The tow truck driver finally told the woman to get out of the SUV. 

Seconds before she gained entry to the vehicle, the tow truck driver also physically assaulted me ( yet another absolute breach of peace ) as well as my neighbor, with the brackets of the tow bar while we were standing at the back of the SUV. By intentionally pressing the button to make the towbar press against the back of our legs in an attempt to scare us to move. Threatening to crush our legs between the tow bar and my vehicle. The two were using very menacing tactics. 

After I successfully got into the driver 's seat of my SUV I was able to get it started, WHILE still wrestling the woman out of my car. Once she finally exited the vehicle, I immediately drove up onto the sidewalk and lawn of the property, to avoid the threat of theft and the threat a police presence creates for an XXXX XXXX like myself. I have a witness and a video recording of what transpired that day. the police were called as well This is the second time Santander Consumer USA has committed a breach of the peace. I have made multiple complaints against/to SANTANDER CONSUMER USA directly , through the CFPB, and the New York Attorney General. I have cited multiple codes that SANTANDER CONSUMER USA has violated in these prior complaints and I have highlighted the misleading verbiage, the outright fraud, and predatory loan practices. 

I have pointed out things such as their failure to disclose all information per the TRUTH IN LENDING ACT and U.S CODE 15 USC 1632 DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS. Santander attempted to dissuade me from exercising my right to rescind the contract and any obligation that may have derived from my signature and ignorance.

In response to my last complaint, Santander directed me to reread the section of the contract that states there is a "" no cooling off period '' in New York. This was true, up until XX/XX/XXXX, which is the date that The State of New York adopted new rules for used car dealers ( I purchased my SUV on XX/XX/XXXX, a full 15 months after the new laws had been adopted ). 

Under these new rules dealers must provide a financing statement in a prescribed form prior to the execution of any retail installment contract. The financing terms must include two annual percentage rates : the contract APR and the lowest APR offered to the buyer by any finance company with the same term, number of payments, collateral, and down payment. It also states that consumers MUST be given an automobile contract cancellation option form that offers a consumer a two-weekday cancellation period. A consumer may use this form to cancel the purchase and receive a full refund. 

The contract presented to me by XXXX had neither. There were no finance company comparisons offered nor was there a cancellation option form presented with the contract. The Truth in Lending Act clearly states that the "" consumer '' is to be informed and properly instructed by the creditor on their options so the consumer can make an informed decision. 

Repossession- verb ( used with object ) to regain ownership of ; to take back. So unless we are using a different definition for repossess, Santander Consumer USA is ultimately committing theft when attempting to take a vehicle they never actually possessed. Santander Consumer USA has violated on so many levels that it bewilders me how this corporation has been allowed to continue to conduct business. 

I have pointed out things such as XXXX 's failure to honor the service contract. I took the XXXX XXXX back to the dealer a week later after purchase to address a problem in the steering column that still exists to this day, yet another breach of contract. 

It has taken some time for me to respond to the last rebuttal from Santander because unfortunately I am just now becoming aware of and comprehending my consumer rights. Santander Consumer USA has taken full advantage of my ignorance of these rights.

04/24/23,"Payday loan, title loan, or personal loan",Installment loan,Getting the loan,None,"On XX/XX/XXXX, I received an invitation to apply via email for a personal loan from XXXX XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX I called to follow-up on the status of my application and was told by XXXX that she was busy and would call back later in the day to finish the application process and determine what documents were needed for the approval. I submitted the requested documentation via the requested portal on XX/XX/XXXX. I provided the banking statements, SSI award benefit letter, and various paystubs from my employers. 

I have been going back and forth with XXXX for the last four weeks providing her unnecessary paperwork from my respective employers. She requested my very first paycheck from my longest employer and asked why the names differed. I explained I work for a franchised location and that name will not be listed on the employer on the outside of the building but would go by the LLC the owner created. She then followed up with for auditing purposes I need for you to provide the W-2 as well to make sure the names align of your employers.

Provided this as well, copies of my banking statement, award statement of SSI benefits. I provided to her three wage statements from my longest employer and the wage statements from my previous employer. Which is strange that I was qualified for the {$4000.00} loan then but once I provided the newest wage statement from my new employer I'm declined without a reason. So, this makes zero sense XXXX is rude, disrespectful, and unprofessional. 

She kept speaking over me and would not provide the reason why my loan was declined. I have more than enough income to accommodate the loan. I have a considerable amount of student loans but was still able to purchase a house last year with providing a letter from my lender proving the amount listed on my credit report is incorrect. Theres not even an amount listed on my report as theyre in deferment. So, this means she took 1 % of the value which of course would make my DTI insanely high as I have over a XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX dollars in student loan debt. 
XXXX intentionally sabotaged and decline my application stating they were unable to verify my income which is incorrect I provided several months worth of wage statements and banking statements. She refused to let me explain my DTI and stated she can not change the amounts which she can. Ive previously provided them a letter from my student loan lender when I had a loan with them in XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX. It appears only XXXX is every the only one working. 

Conveniently her manager was on vacation at the moment during the week of XX/XX/XXXX so I could not speak with her to discuss my concerns about how this situation was handled. When I called to ask for the corporate phone number XXXX became even more unprofessional and rude and told me to XXXX it like everyone else does. I find it odd that she does not have the number to corporate on hand considering it is a financial institution. Last week I asked to speak with her manager about her unprofessionalism she declined and said she could handle the situation without involving her manager.

I thought the purpose of requesting a manager is voice concerns about the various interactions and handling of my application to which she refused. Each time I call in it takes majority of the business day to get a return call or a follow up the following day about the application. I have never had this happen before and I've had three loans with Lendmark in the last ten years alone at this same location. It is troubling that I was approved with the income provided and then a complete 360 once I provided my new way statements. I believe XXXX 's loan declines require additional review and an investigation needs to be launched. The last time I took a loan out with Lendmark in XXXX there were no underwriters in the store, and she claimed the underwriter at her location could not approve the loan due to the DTI to which again we spent 20 minutes talking about my mortgage, two car loans which are the bulk of my credit portfolio at the beginning of the loan process. My loan application should not have been denied and XXXX incorrectly input the information and refused to allow me the chance to submit supporting documentation as I have previously been able to provide for loans with Lendmark Financial. 

I filed a complaint on XX/XX/XXXX, complaint # XXXX and was told I would receive a call back on or before XX/XX/XXXX, to which I followed up on XX/XX/XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX and XXXX failed to relay the message that I wanted to Speak with XXXX XXXX on purpose which means she definitely has something to hide or does not want to be held accountable for intentionally denying an application and incorrectly input the data that was provided. I called corporate this morning ( XX/XX/XXXX ) and was told I needed to wait to speak with XXXX to which I told them she has yet to follow up and I would like the matter escalated. After asking twice the representative told me they would escalate the matter up to XXXX XXXX but it would be on or by XX/XX/XXXX which is unacceptable considering I filed the complaint 10 days ago and requested on multiple occasions to speak with XXXX and XXXX refused to do so.",None,Lendmark Financial Services,CO,80134,None,Consent provided,Web,04/24/23,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,6879394

03/12/23,"Payday loan, title loan, or personal loan",Installment loan,Problem when making payments,None,"As of XX/XX/2022, I was offered financing for a purchase from XXXX for a Motorcycle seat. This was provided by a financial company named AFFIRM , Inc. upon credit approval. The AFFIRM company pays the online Merchant and then sets the buyer up with a payment schedule for the purchase. For a {$380.00} loan, I pay 12 monthly payments of {$32.00}, with an APR of 27.77 % for the purchase of the seat. For approval, I had to submit Checking account information, full S.S. number, email address, and phone number. All had to be verified. My credit score is GOOD and I expected no problems with the approval. At first, everything was fine. I actually ordered 2 more items with AFFIRM financing after the initial purchase. Another from XXXX and one from XXXX. I was making my monthly payments without failure. Then, there were issues with other things involving my personal email addresses that made me suspect that someone was hacking my personal information. I decided to change my phone number as a precaution. That's when the problems began with AFFIRM , Inc . 
Upon attempting to update my phone number with them, they informed me that I would be required to provide transmitted photos of my personal I.D . such as Driver License, Passport, etc. and also a photo of myself. 
At first, I actually tried to comply. I provided a photo of my Military Identification which is for V.A. medical services. However, when I attempted to take a photo of myself, the process failed to complete. I have been in repeated contact with AFFIRM personnel via phone calls and email correspondence. They actually verified my phone number multiple times during conversation by texting a 4-digit code number to my new number. I provided the code number for verification multiple times. Even though it was verified in their system, when attempting to log into my online AFFIRM account, I would provide my phone number as the required information on their website, and a 4-digit code would be automatically sent to my cell phone. Normally, that would allow me access to my online account. However, it would not grant me access to my account. I have tried to resolve this issue since the problems began weeks ago. I can not monitor my accounts with AFFIRM or conduct any functions regarding the 2 remaining accounts ( One has already been paid as agreed ). AFFIRM personnel continue to demand photos of my personal identification and of myself in order to regain account access. I have decided some time ago that I do not feel comfortable providing these photos due to suspicion of I.D . theft. I have even attempted to pay the full remaining balance owed by Credit Card payment and they told me Credit Card payments were not accepted and it had to be a Debit Card or authorization of automatic deduction from my Checking account.

It describes fully the events forming the basis for our complaint. While it includes some personal information, it is the best vehicle to summarize the matter and I have included it in the additional documents section below. 



XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX PNC XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX at PNC XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX Dear XXXX XXXX I am writing to you today to bring to your attention a most disturbing and negative interaction my wife and I recently experienced with your financial institution, PNC Bank, N.A. ( hereinafter PNC ). On XX/XX/XXXX, we spoke with a representative of PNC, XXXX XXXX XXXX ( NMLS # XXXX ), with regard to an application for a Home Owner Equity Line of Credit in the amount of {$160000.00}. As background information, we had established a previous HOE line with PNC in XX/XX/XXXX, in the amount of {$100000.00} to assist with home improvements. The increased credit amount was to accommodate additional improvements we had made to our home, subsequent to that time. XXXX XXXX took our application over the telephone, and assured us with our positive credit profile and favorable credit scores, along with our existing relationship, the increased credit request should be no problem. 

We were subsequently contacted by our XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX # XXXX ), who requested standard documentation to support reported income information. We provided XXXX XXXX with all documents requested. In several discussions with XXXX XXXX, it appeared that she was somewhat overwhelmed by our sources of income. My wife and I are retired, and we generate income from a number of investment sources. I retired in XXXX, and XXXX retired in XXXX. We manage our financial affairs in a sound and prudent manner, and have handled all of our credit obligations impeccably over that fifteen year retirement horizon. The manner in which we generate our income is obviously not the typical situation, such as an applicant who is employed and provides prior years W-2s and recent pay stubs to support their income. My impression was that XXXX XXXX had a difficult time understanding our financial situation. 

My wife and I are both retired XXXX, XXXX XXXX. XXXX spent XXXX years in banking, primarily as the XXXX XXXXXXXX for several financial institutions here in XXXX. I spent XXXX years in the industry, primarily in the lending function. I served as the XXXX XXXX XXXX for XXXX independent banks over the last XXXX years of my banking career. I bring this to your attention as evidence that we know the banking industry and how it operates. I know a qualified credit request, and would not apply for a loan for which we did not qualify. 

You can imagine my shock when I was advised by XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX, that our credit request had been denied by the PNC underwriting department for insufficient income to Page 2 Continuation of Letter to XXXX XXXX XXXX and PNC Bank N.A . 


service the debt. The specific reason identified in the formal Adverse Action Letter we received dated XX/XX/XXXX, was Excessive Obligations in Relation to Income. In several subsequent discussions with XXXX XXXX, wherein I requested additional information and clarification as to how the income and debt service had been calculated, she was unable to provide specific numbers related thereto or the methodology used to derive it by the underwriting department. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I had a lengthy telephone conversation with XXXX XXXX during which she tried to explain how our annual income amount had been calculated. Her explanation was meaningless to me, as the figure she provided ( {$89000.00} in verified income ) had no correlation to any of the income information we had provided. In fact, it was over {$30000.00} less per year than our income verification documents we had submitted for the previous XXXX year period. Because I was insistent that something was wrong or not properly analyzed, XXXX XXXX said she would file an appeal of the decision and have it reviewed by a second underwriter. I have no idea whether or not she filed the appeal, because I never heard from her again. It is my understanding that the telephone calls dealing with credit applications are all recorded by PNC. If that is the case, I believe you would find a review of the XX/XX/XXXX, telephone call most instructive, in terms of providing an accurate summary of the application process we endured and the frustration we experienced in not being able to get credible answers to reasonable questions. 

Subsequent to the XX/XX/XXXX telephone call, I reviewed all of the information XXXX XXXX had provided relative to the credit underwriting. In an attempt to clarify what I perceived as an erroneous assumption by the PNC underwriter, I sent XXXX XXXX a communique by email outlining where I believed the breakdown occurred. A copy of that email is included for your information. It is interesting to note that at the end of the XX/XX/XXXX telephone call ( a Friday ), XXXX XXXX assured me she would contact me early in the following week to discuss the results of her appeal. On XX/XX/XXXX, ( Sunday ) I directed my email to her. Subsequently, I made XXXX separate telephone calls to her, wherein I left voice-mail messages asking her to acknowledge receipt of the email and to update me on the current status of the appeal. I never received a return call from her. My next communication with PNC was the standard Adverse Action Letter which we received by mail on XX/XX/XXXX. 

To say that the manner in which this credit request was handled by PNC is a stain on the companys reputation is an understatement. My wife and I believe we did not receive fair treatment from your bank, XXXX XXXX. Subsequently I have reviewed the entire application and credit denial process with several former colleagues in the banking industry, each of whom have a high level of knowledge and expertise related to the bank lending function. All agreed and are willing to give testimony to the fact that, based upon generally accepted principles of credit-granting criteria, the credit request was not handled in the appropriate manner. Within that context, it is interesting to note that the credit facility my wife and I were denied by PNC was, in fact, granted by a competitive financial institution. We executed loan documents on XX/XX/XXXX. 

Page 3 Continuation of Letter to XXXX XXXX XXXX and PNC Bank N.A . 


I have taken the time to write to you about this incident, XXXX XXXX, in the hope that some degree of review and action on your part will result in meaningful corrective action within PNC to preclude future applicants from receiving the same treatment my wife and I experienced. As I indicated earlier, we felt that the treatment we received from PNC was eminently unfair. More specifically, we believe that age discrimination played a role in the ultimate credit decision, in direct violation of the Equal Credit Opportunity Act. To that end, I have forwarded a copy of this letter to the governmental agency that administers compliance with that federal statute, the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection, in the hope that they will take whatever action they deem appropriate. In addition, we have filed a formal consumer complaint with the subject agency regarding the events outlined in this letter. I would be most interested in hearing your thoughts about the matter, once you have had an opportunity to look into it. 


Sincerely, XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX.

05/18/23,"Payday loan, title loan, or personal loan",Installment loan,Charged fees or interest you didn't expect,None,"Parties involved : XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX ( my day-to-day point of contact ) XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  ( CEO of the parent company XXXX XXXX XXXX  he is on a couple of emails, and his name is attached to the "" Release Agreement '' ) XXXX XXXX XXXX  ( Affiliate Partner of XXXX XXXX ) XXXX XXXX - XXXX ( point of contact that XXXX worked with ) XXXX XXXX XXXX - XXXX ( I don't know who this is, but he was copied on email threads ) Complaint : I applied for a loan, and as a result, it ended up costing me {$5500.00}. Additionally, the lender ordered title work from a title attorney before being 100 % sure they could close the loan. The title company is now demanding payment of {$7300.00} for the abstracts and title work, and the invoice is directed to me. The lender is refusing to pay, and I certainly should not be on the hook for this payment, as I did not direct the lender to order title work, nor was I aware that it had been ordered. 

Details : On or around XX/XX/2023, I began working with XXXX XXXX on a loan to refinance my portfolio of XXXX properties. XXXX XXXX originally reviewed my portfolio and made me an offer. I accepted. Then it moved to XXXX XXXX 's processing & underwriting department, who came back and said XXXX XXXX would not be able to move forward with the loan based on their underwriting algorithms and calculations. 

Around XX/XX/2023, XXXX XXXX came back with a new offer. They involved XXXX of their affiliate partners, Lima One Capital. I was told that Lima 's lending model would work for my portfolio. I was then asked to pay a deposit for the appraisals upfront ... which I thought was highly unusual, but I agreed to do it because the representative ( XXXX ) seemed confident that Lima would be able to close the deal. The total appraisal deposit was {$15000.00}. 

On or near XX/XX/2023, I was informed that the appraisals came back too low, and that Lima One Capital would not be able to close the loan. And that I had lost my {$15000.00} deposit. The justification they gave was, "" you paid for the appraisals '', and you have them. So the work was done, and you paid for the work. 

I argued that I would not have ordered, nor paid for these appraisals without the belief that they would accrue to my receipt of the loan. I argued that this was bordering on Predatory Lending, and this feels like a UDAAP violation. I then sent an email to XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX explaining that what I felt. 

I also felt there was some appraisal bias going on because my properties are in a predominantly XXXX area of town, and because I am a XXXX XXXX XXXX. Additionally, some of the appraisals came back lower than the original appraisals when I purchased the properties. Now, I know that is a heavy card to play, and I didn't have any real, solid proof of that accusation. Therefore, I only mentioned it in my email to XXXX, and didn't really pursue that piece of the matter any further. 

XXXX then came back and offered to settle with me to refund {$10000.00} of the {$15000.00} I paid as a deposit on the appraisals. The made me sign a release agreement that would prevent me from taking further legal action against XXXX XXXX, and that I would not disparage them publicly. I signed this agreement because I am a small business, and I didn't want to start a prolonged legal battle that would end up costing me more money in the long-run. And at that point I thought it was over, and I would just take my {$5500.00} loss and move on. 

Fast forward to XX/XX/2023, the title company sent me an invoice for {$7300.00} for title / abstract work that had been ordered by Lima One Capital for this deal. I then forwarded that invoice and email to XXXX at XXXX. I also called XXXX, and she told me that this was an issue between the lenders and the title company, and that I should not have any liability here. 

Now today, XX/XX/2023, the title company followed up with us about that invoice. XXXX responded to the title company stating that "" that is the risk the title company takes if the loan does not close ''. I saw this email thread was becoming tense, and so I called the title company to ensure that I was not the target of their ire. I don't want to be sued as a result of this matter. And that I do believe that Lima One should pay the title company because they were the group who ordered the title. And it was their faulty business model and processes who had me pay for appraisals before they new with 100 % certainty that they could close the loan. And it was Lima One 's faulty business processes who ordered title prior to knowing with 100 % certainty that they could close the loan. 

Throughout the email exchanges with the title company, XXXX, the representative from Lima One, has been quiet and non-responsive. 

The bottom line here is that : I am a consumer who applied for a loan. And as a result of applying for that loan, I lost {$5500.00}, and could potentially be on the hook for another {$7300.00} ... or worse, I might have to retain an attorney and pay much more in legal fees to defend myself if the title company decides to sue us all. 

How is that right? How is that legal?

The plumbing manager was trying to force me to take a tank water heater when I paid for tankless. I feel like my rights as a homeowner were being trampled on. Is he paying for the job or am I? He has no right to force me to take something. For two to three hours, I had no idea what was going on. At one point I asked for my existing tank to be put back and just cancel the job to the worker and plumbing manager. But my old tank AFTER removal did not work was what I was told. For two to three hours, I had no idea what was going on and did not have peace of mind. I was trying to reach my advisor and called the general number, but could not speak with anyone.

This job is not yet completed and they have taken the money from the lender. My HOA has contacted me regarding the outside and asked when they are coming back to finish everything. I can not give them that day because they have not told me the day. They need to fix/replace the door, the outside lawn area needs work and it needs to pass inspection. They are not in a rush to line this up since they have been paid against my permission, I would have gladly paid them after they have completed all the work.

Fortunately, he said that with my skills as a XXXX Veteran, there was a possibility that I may prevail in receiving funding that others may have not. I provided him with the initial documents that he requested and waited for his response. 

On XX/XX/XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX informed me I had met the initial screening criteria and that although I was a XXXX XXXX, Banner would proceed with the loan application process. Large in part to what he said were strong financials. I filled out the loan application and provided him with updated documents. I also opened a Banner Business account at his suggestion because he said that would look favorable to the loan officer. 

Throughout the month I updated him on changes to my business plan. The largest being a drop in construction costs by {$150000.00}. With each new update, he said that he would note the adjustments in my loan application. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I met with XXXX XXXX, and he informed me that Banner Bank denied the loan due to my debt coverage service ratio. XXXX XXXX explained the SBA standard was 1.25, Banner Banks was 1.4 and mine was only XXXX I asked him to provide me with the calculations, however, he did not. While I was unfamiliar with the ratio, he knew that I had an XXXX from XXXX University and with a little research could understand the calculation, yet he said it was too difficult for me to comprehend. 

As the conversation went on, I pointed out to him that although I had provided him with updated figures, he had erroneously used the original infill costs in his calculations. I also explained that my monthly income had increased and asked if that would change my coverage ratio. He said that he would inform the loan officer of the changes and that he would update me the following week if that would change the banks response. On XXXX XXXX, regardless of my updated figures, he emailed me that I was denied. XXXX XXXX expressed extreme remorse and said that he would work with a non-profit agency where he served on the board to help me obtain funding. 

I was shocked. Until that point, although he did not say definitively that I would be approved, he did say that I was a great candidate, and that he would be surprised if I was denied. In our conversations about my chances, I would say If I am approved and he would respond You mean when you are approved. 

While I received my initial declination via mail at approximately the same time, I continued to request a more detailed explanation. From the moment and the way XXXX XXXX spoke to me in his office, I did not think that his calculation of my debt service coverage ratio was legitimate. Frankly, I did not believe that XXXX XXXX was being truthful. He was evasive in providing me with a more detailed denial reason and barely looked me in the eye. His continued reassurance to me that he was remorseful and that he would work with other lenders to help me secure a loan seemed disingenuous. 

As I waited for the second denial letter, I started working with another agency for a loan. Within hours of sending the loan officer my business plan, he responded with a slew of questions and suggestions about my profit loss statement, none of which XXXX XXXX raised. That was when I realized I made simple XXXX formatting errors which made me question whether XXXX XXXX or his loan officer read the plan or planned to deny my request regardless of my qualifications. 

After several requests, on XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX sent me a second denial letter which stated I was denied for the following reasons : personal net worth, debt service coverage ratio, and start-up/length of time in business. Since he had told me and another colleague previously that I was denied solely based on my coverage ratio, I asked for the third party to verify that in writing. 

My net worth far exceeds the amount requested ; I requested {$400000.00} and my net worth is over {$890000.00}. As for being a new start-up, XXXX XXXX said in XXXX that before Banner Bank would even proceed with my loan request, I had to pass the banks initial screening about being a start-up business which he said I met.

05/26/23,"Payday loan, title loan, or personal loan",Installment loan,Incorrect information on your report,Account status incorrect,"I reached out to the company through XXXX dispute process multiple times. I informed them that the information that they are reporting is incorrect. They came back stating that the account was verified. I filed a formal complaint on XXXX and began to work directly with Affirm. I disputed 3 Affirm accounts as inaccurate. Account : XXXX Account : XXXX Account : XXXX No payments were late or missed prior to the deferment. The company granted a deferment therefore the payment schedule was off but they payments were not considered late. The payments were paid as agreed. XXXX is also listing this account with Affirm as the account holder. The lender is actually XXXX XXXX XXXX. To date they have been unable to provide me proof or is lacking proof that the alleged payments were in fact late although they were deferred. Ive asked that the payment history on the account be updated to paid as agreed never late ( PAANL ) OR at minimum the late payments removed. The company should have provided this information within 15 days after receiving my follow-up dispute sent in with additional information. 

Customer Service is a representative of the company. The arrangement agreed upon with that department should be honored by the company. The direct complaint filed with Affirm hasnt had a satisfactory resolution. The rep reviewing the complaint provided me a list of dates of payments. This is not helpful. Ive acknowledged that the payment schedule changed but they were paid as agreed upon by their representative according to the deferment that was granted. This is the gist of my issue. The late payments should be removed based on the agreement that their customer service representative agreed to approve. Next steps are to file a complaint with the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. 


Ive listed the Affirm direct complaint information below. 

I was having some financial hardships at the time. I called into Affirms customer service department in order to request a loan/payment deferment. The customer service reps advised me that this was ok. I agreed to make the payments going forward prior to the XXXX of every month until the loans were paid in full. I also mentioned that I would make multiple payments in the months that I could to offset the deferment and avoid extending the time of the loans. Again, per your customer service this was ok and my request due to extenuating circumstances was granted. I upheld my end of the bargain as agreed however Affirm has not. The loans are being reported on my credit report as late. Loans and/or payments that are in deferment can not and should not be reported to credit bureaus as late. Can this please be corrected as soon as possible? Although the accounts have now been paid in full, I am being negatively impacted by the incorrect information being reported. Per the consumer finance laws in the State of Texas, I have the right to have the late payments removed. Please update the accounts to only a paid status without any late payments OR please update the accounts to paid in full never late since deferred payments can not be considered late payments. Thank you. I appreciate your speedy resolution of this matter. Please feel free to reach out with any questions to anything that wasnt addressed in this correspondence. For the sake of clarity, Im not contesting that the payments were made outside of the payment schedule. What Im affirming is prior to the payments being late I reached out to your customer service department and spoke with them about deferring the payments. This was agreed upon on both ends.

They recommended to secure financing for the project through one of their preffered partners, a company named Mosaic. 

I went ahead and submitted the application with Mosaic and got approved for the loan for the entire solar panel cost of {$26000.00}. 

I setup my account and started making monthly payments to Mosaic. 

Fast forward to more than a year later, the solar panel has not completed the job. They have failed every single inspection to get the job approved by the city and connect the solar panels to the grid. 

The solar panel does not respond to my phone calls, when I finally get through they just say that they will investigate and get back to me, but they never do. 

So I have put 3 complains on 3 separate occasions with Mosaic, the financing company about the issue that I'm having but they seem to be unable to provide any help with this matter. 

Originally I was told by them that they only paid XXXX XXXX XXXX a small down payment to initiate the project and that the final payment is done after project is fully completed. 

But today, XX/XX/2023 after I call to complain for the third time, the Mosaic representative informs me that XXXX XXXX XXXX has already been paid in full. 

That makes sense, since XXXX XXXX doesn't show any desire to move forward or complete my project.

As soon as I found out about these charges, I called Truist and reported the matter. I was told that it would be investigated and I would be informed of the results in a week. That was a promise never fulfilled. 

Six months passed and during that time I made numerous phone calls to so many different departments of Truist but all were in vain. The only thing I was told was that those unauthorized withdrawals were the result of an internal fraud of Truist Bank and the matter was under investigation.

02/20/23,"Payday loan, title loan, or personal loan",Installment loan,Charged fees or interest you didn't expect,None,"After a home improvement project, the bill was {$29000.00}. The contractor put me with company named "" Goodleap '' offering "" 6 months no interest. '' Their loan document provided on XX/XX/XXXX, eight days before funding stated : "" Your first payment date will be due approximately six months ( the Promotional Period ) after your loan start date. '' Because of this, upon loan funding of XX/XX/XXXX, I expected my first payment to be around XX/XX/XXXX. 

The loan funded on XX/XX/XXXX while I was away on vacation, and they emailed a "" Loan Closing Certificate. '' Upon my return about two weeks later, I received the Loan Closing Certificate as well as Goodleap 's first monthly statement dated XX/XX/XXXX in email. 

The Loan Closing Certificate said my "" promotional period '' ( of no interest ) is six months. It also said my "" first payment date '' is XX/XX/XXXX. This made no sense because this is seven months later and the loan document of XX/XX/XXXX previously stated that my first payment date would be in six months. 

The statement dated XX/XX/XXXX also said my "" first payment date '' is XX/XX/XXXX, but there was no mention whatsoever about the "" promotional period. '' This worried me, so I logged on to my account on Goodleap 's website and could not find any further terms or information about the promotional period and what the actual date was to pay by to avoid paying interest in line with their "" 6 months no interest '' offer. 

Because of these discrepancies, I called Goodleap 's customer service line and they assured me that my first payment date of XX/XX/XXXX is correct and not to worry. So I believed them and did not worry when I saw the same thing on each subsequent monthly statement from XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX. Since I thought what they told me was correct, I planned to pay them off about a week before XX/XX/XXXX. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I got a different looking statement dated XX/XX/XXXX showing that the promotional period expired on XX/XX/XXXX and I owed them {$1700.00} ( now {$1900.00} ) in interest. I called them immediately but nobody could help me as it was late in the day on Friday. Immediately after hanging up, I logged in and paid the entire {$29000.00} I owed them. 

The following week I finally spoke on the phone with someone who said she would get my issue to the right department. I then got an email from their representative, XXXX XXXX. He stated that the payment date of XX/XX/XXXX was correct and that I owe them interest of almost {$2000.00} because I missed the promotional period payoff date of XX/XX/XXXX. I wrote back saying that I missed the date because they provided conflicting payment information, and never gave the actual date to pay off by the end of the promotional period. 

Because of the conflicting misinformation provided by their documents and phone representative, I asked him to please reverse all interest and close the account. He wrote back saying that they could not reverse owed interest on this loan. 

The only payment date they gave was XX/XX/XXXX and never provided the date of the end of the promotional period to avoid interest. Every single creditor I have ever had that offered free financing has been clear about the terms of the promotional period and provided the exact date to pay by in order to avoid interest. I believe that Goodleap deliberately omits this date from all their documents and statements to confuse people into missing that payment so they can charge for a lot of accrued interest.

I rarely accessed my checking, savings, credit card and line of credit. On or about XX/XX/XXXX I paid the full balance of {$4400.00} on the accounts and requested that the line of credit and credit card be closed. On XX/XX/XXXX Regions placed at {$47.00} maintenance fee on an account that was supposed to be closed. The fee then turned in {$190.00} because there were no notifications sent via email, mail or phone. I had this account for more than 5 years it shows that the fees were always taken from the checking account. During this period there was roughly {$24000.00} in the checking account. I was unaware that the line of credit was still open or there were fees being added and late payments being applied to the credit reports. When I purchased my house in XXXX I was notified of this on my report from XX/XX/XXXX then again on XXXX, XXXX and XXXX of XXXX. After contacting Regions 100s of times about this matter I finally got a rep named XXXX that said this was wrong and he would work to get the reports corrected. After about 60 days the reports updated and the negative lines were removed. There was a delay in my house closing which caused them the run my credit report again the day before closing and the negative lines were placed back on my report.

In XX/XX/XXXX, we took out a home improvement loan with EnerBank USA for {$19000.00}. We had two years - no interest- to pay it back. The full amount was due by XX/XX/XXXX. 

We paid monthly on the loan and planned to pay the remainder off by XX/XX/XXXX. I had a family emergency in XXXX and XXXX and by the time I was able to think straight again, my husband and I realized we'd missed the XX/XX/XXXX deadline. My husband went on the EnerBank USA website and thought he found the full amount owed and paid it off on XX/XX/XXXX. He tried to call EnerBank to see if the loan was now closed but after an hour on hold, he wasn't able to get through. I then took over and after two hours on hold - was disconnected once and had to call back, I finally reached a customer service representative who said that we owed over {$7000.00} dollars in interest because we didn't pay the entire loan off by XX/XX/XXXX. From XX/XX/XXXX, on, we were being charged 17.99 % interest on {$19000.00} even though we'd paid half the loan off by XX/XX/XXXX and the whole loan off by XX/XX/XXXX. That didn't matter to EnerBank because they charge 17.99 % daily on the full loan amount even though we'd paid half back over the two years. Yes. We had a signed contract with them and we knew that they charge exorbitant interest rates if the loan isn't paid in time and we had every intention of paying it in time but due to a family emergency, we were delayed. 

I explained the situation to the customer service rep and she said there was nothing we could do. I asked to speak with a manager. She said the manager would tell me the same thing. I told her I still wanted to speak to a manager and see if they could reduce the penalty since we'd paid 1/2 the loan off by XX/XX/XXXX and the full loan two months later. She put me on hold and after a half hour she came back to say no manager was able to speak to me. I told her I would wait and she told me that someone would call me back in 24 hours.

I waited 24 hours and no one called. 

I then began to do extensive research on EnerBank and found that my experience was similar to so many customers and the reviews were scathing. I went on the XXXX website and found hundreds if not one thousand reviews of their predatory habits. I read about people losing their homes because of them. Here are the key issues I'd like you to look into : Their online portal : It is almost impossible to get a payment history. I had to go through two years of XXXX banking statements to make sure I knew what we'd paid to date, as EnerBank doesn't have that information on their online portal. 
Their customer service : Customers wait hours on hold and never actually get to speak to a manager Their unwillingness to work with customers : There was no attempt to even discuss my situation with anyone. Thankfully, my husband and I were able to come up with the money once we realized they'd not budge and would continue to tack on 17.99 % interest every day on a {$19000.00} loan that we'd paid off. A manager called me back and left a voicemail for me to call them back at the toll free number. No extension- just call the toll free number and wait again, which I did, only to be told that the message the manager who'd called me had was 'No- nothing could be done about the interest. ' End of story. 
When I paid off the interest penalty today ( {$7300.00} ), I was on a recorded line. I explained to the customer service representative that I was not upset with her but that I was going to share my thoughts about EnerBank on the recorded line because I think their business practices are shady and their unwillingness to even speak with the customer and come up with a reasonable solution is criminal. 

In addition to researching customer reviews on EnerBank, I see that they are offering huge sign-on bonuses for people to work in their collections department. Of course they are. The only way to pay off a loan with them is with cash/checking/debit. You can't pay it off with a lower interest credit card so you are forced to pay their daily interest rates ( which are huge ) until you have the cash to pay it off. I can completely see how easily someone can go under if even one thing goes wrong with their loan. 

Of course, I made a mistake getting distracted in XXXX and forgetting to pay off the balance. That was my error and it cost my husband and me but I worry about the people who can't come up with the cash to pay the huge interest they charge and who try, desperately, to get through to someone at EnerBank to help come up with a payment plan but are told there is no flexibility, no willingness to even discuss or hear a customer 's story. 

I have filed a complaint with the XXXX. I let the company who did our home improvement ( who directed us to work with EnerBank ) know about our experience and they are going to share it with the team of other companies they know who use them. That company- XXXX 's XXXX in XXXX, XXXX, tried to reach out to their contact at EnerBank but never heard back.

He ended up having to create another, smaller version of XXXX  ( he contoured it a bit more this time ). It was a lot more bearable. Next appointment scheduled for XXXX XXXX XXXX was XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX. 

However, I MUST NOTE my Disdain because I was completely under the assumption that I was receiving the end-product I agreed to pay {$36000.00} for, which was well communicated to XXXX XXXX that he insisted I would be happy with the completion of the procedure. 
On XX/XX/XXXX, the day the XXXX XXXX were to be installed XXXX XXXX never explained the full procedure to me, nor explained if there was any need for modifications or issues with my XXXX that would prevent me from obtaining the perfect XXXX  I requested with the exact XXXX XXXX XXXX I paid for ( see treatment plan attached ). 
During the operation to my XXXX as a patient I was totally unable to view what was taking place in my XXXX by XXXX XXXX while conducting this transformation.

He said that is the immediate appearance thats common for all his patients undergoing this type of procedure and that once the swelling goes down, I would be able to see the difference. 

Days after final installation I reached out, I made complaints to XXXX XXXX that I was not satisfied with the outcome due to the bulkiness of the XXXX that didnt fit my face, and that I was experiencing discomfort while XXXX  ( again ), Extreme sensitivity, and my XXXX was NOT aligned. On XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX I had an appointment, He asked me to come in so he could see what he could do. He continued insisting that he can make XXXX XXXX and contour my XXXX  as small fixes assuming that would do the trick, but I wasn't happy at all! I constantly shared that this is NOT the end result I hoped for. 

I had another appointment on XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX, to AGAIN, try to arrive at a place of satisfactory, because I continue to have unsightly bulkiness and extreme sensitivity while XXXX. XXXX XXXX again, tried to contour some more, and attempted to further adjust my XXXX

In complete befuddlement, I asked her what can I do to get the XXXX XXXX XXXX I requested and she disappointingly informed me that I was not able to receive that look anymore. 
After being fully educated at that moment with XXXX XXXX of XXXX XXXX XXXX, I learned that for XXXX  your XXXX  would have to be filed down no less than [ XXXX ] so that it can be placed on the exterior of XXXX XXXX As for XXXX your XXXX have to be shaved down even more at a [ XXXX ] to fit over the existing XXXX 
This means my XXXX is shaved down too low to ever receive the look and product I paid so much money for because XXXX XXXX took the liberty to do a procedure I did not ask for without confirming with me what I thought about it or what I feel about it before he did a irreversible operation without my authorization, which was not in our Treatment plan agreement, nor does the paperwork I signed indicate a XXXX XXXX of XXXX to the financial department that helped me fund with these installment loans that I am obligated to pay for ( with interest ). 
The paperwork submitted to each of the above financial companies also received the exact document I received that clearly stated. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX 
I insisted after I returned from my vacation to XXXX with my fianc that I was going to address this issue with XXXX XXXX one last time with hopes he can explain what he did and what type of material he used to place in my XXXX 

Once I arrived back home to XXXX XXXX I made it my business to reach out to XXXX XXXX for an appointment to simply record the meeting with him after now understanding from another doctor what happened. I brought a recorder since it is perfectly legal in my state of residence, New Jersey, which is a one consent state that allows you to take video or voice recording of any conversation to protect yourself as a consumer. 
On XX/XX/XXXX I walked in the office waiting to see XXXX XXXX. As I sat in the waiting room I mentioned the receptionist whom I ask purposely of her opinion for the record to identify why my XXXX are so huge and bulky and her response was said on the recording that she didn't think they were bulky -looking but she sees what I mean. I made sure my Audio recorder ( see audio attached ) was on to get a full statement from the XXXX XXXX that seemed very upset and aggravated with a hint of frustration to my direct questions about XXXX XXXX XXXX  What he stated made no sense to me, and very much not what I was told in the beginning or I would have never allowed myself to sit in his chair to do what he did to me without giving me the privilege as a client or consumer the option to decline or accept his method used. 
Now I have an irreversible situation that will not allow me to reach the perfect XXXX I worked so hard to achieve by saving all my funds accordingly to anticipate this process with great results for the money I was spending. 
I felt very much violated and discriminated against because of the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX knowing that if I was of another ethnicity I would not have been treated in such a manner with no regard to what I requested, nor any type of real explanation for so long. 
So I decided to contact the CFPB within the statute of limitations to report this dental office and specific dentist as well as the financial companies that were either lied to by XXXX XXXX of the type of procedure he was doing or participated in the type of procedure received. 
Either way, the paperwork never changed to identify the incorrect work done. ( XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX 
In Conclusion, I would like to see the paperwork from each financial company : Green Sky Program  and XXXX XXXX XXXX in full detail that reveals the breakdown of the requested work that was to be performed by XXXX XXXX describing these services that I agreed to pay for. 
If this paperwork has not been corrected with either one of these companies I need an explanation why? And if the documents were changed, why did I not get the change order of the treatment plan paperwork as well clearly stating I received crowns and not XXXX and the reason why? I received NO FURTHER CONSULTATION from XXXX XXXX describing the need to install ALL XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX which is what I asked and agreed to pay for, per my attached treatment plan. Furthermore, im also pointing out that I was charged for an XXXX  that I DID NOT receive.

I had been going through a lot financially having my nephew XXXX  and brother passing they both had no insurance, and my sister who was the mother of my nephew lost her job, she was living with me, and I had an elderly mother. Prior to my brother and nephew passing, my brother had some serious XXXX  medical conditions which required me to assist with his care. 
I say all of that to say this OneMain knew my situation, the guy who I spoke with initially was a gentleman. I had no reason to not think they were there to help me. They told me they could give me XXXX, I was like great can pay some stuff off, then it became put up your title, I had a XXXX with a very low balance with XXXX XXXX. I said I really didnt want to do it that because it will be paid off soon. Ok, this guy said you will get the XXXX, XXXX and your payment would be like XXXX a month, that is an estimate cant remember the exact amount. Well came signing day for this amount got a call now the amount is down to I think XXXX I go to the office they have me sign some paper they read the papers and then the show me where to sign. 
They did pay off the car had held the title. I made start making payments, if I called in the payments, you would get do you need some more money. I thought how that can be, so that went on for a few weeks/months. Then on a Saturday I spoke with a XXXX she said XXXX XXXX you need some more money I can get you XXXX, I said it will change my payments not that much. I said OK, mind you she knows my story as well. I get a XXXX not the XXXX. Time goes on and then I am on the phone with the first gentlemen I spoke with he says you can get XXXX. I said I dont want to do that will increase my payments, well I was told we have options if you need it, the money is here. I get the XXXX payment goes to over XXXX a month. I am having difficulty paying and they do a few deferral payments. 
I then start falling behind. This company would call me over 10 times a day. XXXX XXXX XXXX called my job and told them she was my friend to call her. My coworker from another department contacts me via instant messaging and gives me the number. I called her and asked did she call and say she was my friend and she said yes, I did. I told her about my issues, and I think she did another deferral. 
I explained that eventually I would need another car the XXXX was running but not in the best shape. This is prior to the XXXX. I was told by XXXX dont worry about it just trade it in and we will refinance the rest. I am like ok great which meant a lower payment to them, and reliable transportation for me. Well, a few months later I tried doing just that went to dealer, they offered XXXX I call OneMain, get XXXX told her the conversation I had and she OH we dont do that, I said that is not what I was told, they all had amnesia. I said I know what I was told, I do a trade in you would refinance the balance. Their response sorry we dont do that you would have to pay off your loan in full. I was told I would be sued if I did not pay the balance in full and my wages garnished. The calls became unbearable sometimes 8-9 times a day into the night. I called back and got XXXX at a later date, and she said let me call you back, she then calls me from her cell phone, I did not recognize the number, so I answered, and it was her. She proceeds to tell me this happens all the time, there are people that get loans and never make any payments at all, at least you are trying. She stated that white people do it all the time.

My second request was denied because of the representative stating that she further reviewed the law and the footnote stating that : Ohio Law Note. The term obligation is defined as, any retail installment sales contract, other contract for the purchase of goods or services, or bond, bill, note, or other instrument of writing for the payment of money arising out of a contract or other transaction for the purchase of goods or services. Ohio Rev. Code Ann. 1343.031 ( A ) ( 2 ) ( West 2004 ). 
But that does not matter because the federal law was addressing OBLIGATIONS and LIABILITIES. The unsecured loan I have with One Main is considered a liability. A liability is money you owe to another person or institution. 
7.1.1. Covered Debt Obligations The 6 % interest cap applies to all obligations and liabilities incurred by a servicemember, individually, jointly with a spouse,166 or in the name of a closely held business entity.167 In addition, courts have held that the cap applies to XXXX  XXXX repayment plans168 and foreign judgments.169 In contrast, some state courts held that the interest protections do not cover debts incurred by servicemembers during or after active duty ends.170 Moreover, debts incurred solely by a servicemembers spouse are not eligible for the 6 % interest cap under the SCRA, but may be under the Ohio Revised Code.171 If my request is denied again I would appreciate a denial letter specifically stating why I dont qualify for Ohio SCRA benefits. Thank you hope to hear from you soon! 

Any help on getting this matter resolved would be greatly appreciated this is the only financial institution that refuses to honor my Ohio SCRA benefits. Thank you.",None,OneMain Finance Corporation,IA,528XX,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,07/21/23,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,7277612

I contact Solo on XX/XX/XXXX to inform them that I was revoking my authorization for ACH payments to my checking account and debit card. They responded to that email. I tried countless time to reach customer service to discuss the issues and there is NO live customer service. They require you use a chat interface, submit a ticket, or email. I called the headquarters in XXXX XXXX and you get a voicemail system that usually full and you if you leave a message no one ever calls you back. 

I repeated my request to revoke the ACH authorization several times in writing each month since XX/XX/XXXX. I also sent a demand letter stating that the interest that they charged with the fees exceeded the legal limit in XXXX XXXX and I was owed a refund.

I would like to settle the balance remaining based the allowable 36 % APR despite that you are not licensed to lend money in the state I reside. Solo now owes a refund to me of {$1700.00}.

Despite dozens of attempts to communicate through all the channels at Solo I would always receive a pre written response to screen shot my error message and they would never answer any of my questions or allow me to speak with customer service.

The reason that I asked this is because I wanted to payoff my loan, but the payoff in which they gave me was higher than I expected. 

When I originally took out the loan in 2021 I was not informed the way in which the Rule of 78 works. After doing a significant amount of research I found that the Rule of 78 is widely considered a prepayment penalty due to it having the same impact as a prepayment penalty. The only difference is that in the eyes of the federal government prepayment penalty is a contractual charge imposed by a lender for early loan repayment, while the Rule of 78 is an interest calculation method that can result in similar effects to a prepayment penalty, as the borrower may not receive a full refund of prepaid interest. Even so, the Rule of 78 itself acts as an alternative route to charging a prepayment penalty as the true unearned interest amount is severely skewed when using its archaic methodology. 

With this in mind I would like to add that there are financial courses that XXXX  offer that state the Rule of 78s is a prepayment penalty. In addition XXXX  courses teaching this there are also several states namely Missouri that have deemed the Rule of 78s a prepayment penalty due to how it heavily favors the lender thus prohibiting the use of them for all loan types. Please refer to Missouri SB 0528 to see their decision.

The solar panels were put on years before I purchased the home and were owned by XXXX with a lease agreement built in. Unbenknownst to me ; XXXX had work done on the roof back in XXXX and whoever put the solar panels back down did not do it correctly. So from XXXX the panels worked fine and then all of the sudden XX/XX/XXXX they stopped working. I began to call Tesla customer support ; which I waited for hours each time on hold when I called ; would get someone on the phone and get transferred around and around. I would have to explain that the solar panels were not reporting or communicating anymore and were not working. They told me it was because I needed a new gateway ; which they sent out. Over a month went by and I received no gateway, so I began calling again and again ; day after day. After SIX MONTHS I received the gateway, with no instructions or help... so I called Tesla again and they said "" the gateway is just a device it has nothing to do with the panels not working ; we need to get someone out there ''. XXXX you I was asking for someone to come out to the house for months. No one came out to the house, I had to call back another 4-7 times and then finally around XX/XX/XXXX someone came and looked at the panels and said it would be {$3700.00} to fix them because they burnt out. He even stated this was not my fault at all and to file a work order and Tesla would take care of it ... .boy was I wrong. After calling, putting in requests through the app, emailing for over 8 MONTHS!!!! no one came out, no one would confirm anything and no one would acknowledge anything. So, I had enough I called the company that controlled the inverter and they came out the next day ( great company ) and they even replaced the inverter FOR FREE!!!! no questions asked hoping that would help but it didn't. The problem still lied with Tesla to fix the panels themselves. So it's now Fall of XXXX ( I started this process XX/XX/XXXX ) ; and I called into Tesla over and over again; finally they assigned my case to a women named XXXX XXXX ( I have all of our email correspondence ). She ASSURED ME that this would be taken care of and I woulnd't have to pay a dime. She took a month to get all the facts together and go through the 20+ times I called in over the last 1.5 years and submitted the request to management. Tesla management came back saying they wouldn't help unless I could prove that I wasn't the one who messed with the roof or panels. Simple enough, I got the previous owner XXXX XXXX on the phone and she gave me the information of the company used to do the roof work. I called them myself and confirmed XXXX XXXX XXXX from XXXX MD completed the work. XXXX told me that with all this informaiton and the terrible customer service I recieved over the last 2 years would be enough to get this done for me. MORE LIES. She came back and asked me to get more information, which i got ; then asked me to get documentation which i got and more and more and more. I got everything she asked for ... .then on XX/XX/XXXX I receive an email from XXXX XXXX who states that the only outcome is for ME TO PAY THE FULL BALANCE TO GET THEM FIXED and that XXXXesla would not help at all. So I got all the information proving I wasn't at fault as requested, I got the roofing company to admit they did the work, and gave all of this to Tesla ; let 's not forget that this took OVER 2 YEARS FOR THEM TO DO A SIMPLE REVIEW PROCEDURE.

04/13/23,"Payday loan, title loan, or personal loan",Installment loan,Getting the loan,None,"I am writing to file a complaint against Wells Fargo for denying my loan application despite having been a loyal customer of the bank for eight years. I applied for a loan to consolidate my credit card debt and help me get through a job transition, but my application was denied because my debt-to-income ratio was considered too high. 

I have a credit score of XXXX, XXXX and XXXX which is not poor, and my main source of debt is my student loans amounting to {$60000.00}. However, I am party to a class action lawsuit that resulted in the full discharge of my student loan debt. Although the process has not yet been completed, Wells Fargo did not consider this information in my loan application, stating that they would only consider current information on my credit report. This is unfair and unjust. 

The denial of my loan application has put me in a very difficult financial situation as I will not be able to pay my bills. Furthermore, this decision will have a negative impact on my credit score. Making it even harder to find a loan and preventing me from having the capital I need to start making more income. 

I believe that Wells Fargo 's actions are in violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act, which requires lenders to provide accurate and fair credit reports, and investigate and correct any errors on credit reports. In my case, Wells Fargo 's failure to consider my impending student loan discharge is a clear violation of this act. Wells had approved me 2 months prior when I checked my rate i did not proceed because inwas just exploring my options at the time as ineas anticipating the transition. nothing changed between the first and second application. I even went to the bank and tried to get a loan with the representative, bringing the necessary evidence to demonstrate the student loan debt would be clear. I also have a recorded call with a representative who told me the only information Wells Fargo considers is what is currently showing on my credit report. I was supposed to get a call back and never did. 

Moreover, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act prohibits lenders from discriminating based on race, religion, national origin, sex, marital status, or age. I have not experienced discrimination based on any of these factors, but the failure of Wells Fargo to consider my impending student loan discharge could be interpreted as a form of discrimination against my financial status. 

I am requesting that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau investigate this matter thoroughly and take appropriate action against Wells Fargo. I believe that I deserve fair treatment and the opportunity to improve my financial situation without any discrimination. I now don't even know what I am going to do because i am a single parent. I recieve no child supoort and i have no family or friends I can go-to for money.

Frustrated by what appeared to be a bait and switch scam on the part of XXXX XXXX and XXXX I went on XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX and submitted a request for a home equity loan. I was immediately contacted via phone by a loan officer from loanDepot who seemed to understand my needs and the fact that I had no desire whatsoever for a cash out refinance. I informed him of my current income and provided substantiating documents. At no point was I asked permission to perform a hard pull of my credit file as he informed me they were such a large bank he could do a soft pull without impacting my credit score. I was unable to view a couple of emails he had sent inviting me to establish a web account, but was able to set up an account on my own at a later time. It requested some additional documents, which I provided. A week or so went by and I began to receive texts and calls from other lending officers from loanDepot with the theme of "" we're sorry we couldn't earn your business, but perhaps we can interest you in a cash out refinance.

I logged onto the site a short time later and found a notice stating they could not extend a HELOC to me at this time, but suggested I consider some of the other financial products they offer.

I noticed my credit score had dropped and both a soft and unauthorized hard pull of my file had been performed by loanDepot.

03/05/23,"Payday loan, title loan, or personal loan",Personal line of credit,Charged fees or interest you didn't expect,None,"In XXXX, we took out at home credit loan from XXXX  XXXX XXXX XXXX. At a banking interaction with US Bank, the bank representative sold us on what appeared to be a better home credit deal through US Bank. He convinced us that the US Bank loan was a better deal for us. Weve attached emails from XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX that show details of what we understood the US Bank home loan to entailed. You can see through the emails that the US bank representative misunderstood aspects of the loan and never mentioned the loan had a variable interest rate ; however, we thought the loan did save us money so we decided to switch to the US Bank loan. The representative quickly went through the loan details with us during the signing. Our understanding was that the loan had an initial XXXX % percent interest rate for XXXX months then moving to a fixed rate of XXXX % for the remainder of the loan. We verbally confirmed with US Bank representative during the signing that the loan was fixed rate. 

In XX/XX/XXXX, we realized our loan payments had increased. We emailed both our US Bank branch XXXX and the representative who sold us the loan. See attached email dated XX/XX/XXXX. Neither of them responded to the email, so we followed up by phone call. The branch XXXX explained over the phone that the loan we signed was varied interest rate, only USBanks profit was fixed, and made no effort to correct the situation. We were shocked and frustrated at the admission of our loan rate being variable based on federal interest rates. We have excellent credit score and would not have agreed to US Banks loan if we had known it was a variable interest rate. 

Continuing to try to find a more sustainable solution, we called US Bank to explain that we were misled about the interest rates and ask for a solution prior to the next anticipated XXXX XXXX XXXX increase that would take effect on XX/XX/XXXX. We spoke with the USBank representative who sold us the loan on XX/XX/XXXX and he said he had been confused about the loan and that he would also be upset about the huge rate increase that led to a huge increase in our monthly payment. He told us he would make it right and work with the bank underwriter to lock in our loan at a lower rate. We attempted multiple times to follow up with him on his phone and through the bank branch, but we never received a return call. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, we sent the US Bank representative an email regarding the situation and we copied the loan underwriter as well as the US Bank XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. Attached are the emails showing that, even though we were misled on the interest rate, US Bank is not doing anything to correct the situation. We are currently paying an additional {$1100.00} a month on our loan because we were misled about the conditions of the loan and the details of the loan were not adequately explained during the signing. 

We want US Bank to return our loan to the XXXX % rate and lock in this rate as we were never informed that it was a variable interest rate and clearly the US Bank representative was confused about the details of the loan. Furthermore, we want to be refunded by US Bank for all additional payments above the 3.25 % interest rate.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,U.S. BANCORP,ID,83706,None,Consent provided,Web,03/05/23,Closed with monetary relief,Yes,N/A,6651930

06/28/23,"Payday loan, title loan, or personal loan",Installment loan,Problem with the payoff process at the end of the loan,None,"I am writing this letter to formally initiate a complaint against Wells Fargo regarding a loan I have had with them since XXXX. I have refinanced the loan with XXXX over the years in a effort to pay off the Wells Fargo loan but this loan with Wells Fargo still remains even after being paid off. 
The complaint is this : I have worked with XXXX XXXX on two separate occasions to pay off the debt with Wells Fargo, originally Wachovia. Each time payment in full was made but subsequently the loan has continued to remain on the books. I have been writing Wells Fargo trying to get this matter resolved but each time they respond it is with the same form letter stating that I can request a Mediation meeting, I have requested the meeting and to this date a mediation meeting has not been scheduled. 


So, I am writing to present my case to the Consumer Finance Department. Here are the issues that I have been addressing with Wells Fargo : This first time, I started the loan was wo bring my business to Wells Fargo since that is where I currently had my checking account. I refinanced a loan form XXXX XXXX and Loan in the amount of {$64000.00} At this time, the then attorney XXXX XXXX XXXX, stated that he had discovered other bills that had not been paid off and added those items ( which were later verified as having been paid off the documents were filed with the XXXX Clerk of court ). 

Second the loan amount was increased, and a line of credit was added to the loan. I have detailed the information below : Several mistakes involving my Line of Credit of {$29000.00}, which was established back on XX/XX/XXXX. This LOC was taken out on a refinance loan with Wachovia to pay off my debts and my current mortgage on my home. 
I refinanced my home again on XX/XX/XXXX, with Wachovia and the {$29000.00} LOC was paid off. I kept receiving bills showing that it had not paid off ; so I continued paying on the debt. The home was refinanced again on XX/XX/XXXX, with XXXX XXXX XXXX which paid it off once more, but I continued receiving bills to make monthly payments which I continued to pay. 
o The issue with the LOC : Wells Fargo sent me the front copy of two checks that were made out to XXXX Title Loan Check No XXXX in the amount of {$310.00} from the General Ledger Check No XXXX in the amount of {$29000.00} was written to them from a Credit Line Cash Advance Counter Check. The purpose of this check is listed as Disb. to Attorney ( Proceeds ). This check opens a line of credit. One half of the check shows paid to XXXX Title loan and the other side shows Pay to the order of Myself. The bank has told me that they only have the front copy of these checks and that no image of the back has been recorded in their files. 
This issue is very suspicious because as noted below the attorney, XXXX XXXX XXXX, in this matter was disbarred for misconduct. I have been searching my files and requesting information from Wachovia and Wells Fargo trying to correct the wrongs, while paying the loans to ensure that I did not lose my home and land. 
I have been delayed in pushing forward because of my health and each time I seem to move forward I have had major health challenges that required my full attention to ensure that I recovered. But I want you to know that I have never stopped trying to have my case represented. 
On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a letter from The Supreme Court of South Carolina, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX stating the lawyer who represented me in the refinancing was being investigated and they would also look into my allegations of fraud for my LOC of {$29000.00} that had not been paid off. 
Also, I had to ask Wells Fargo to stop the digital transfer withdrawals that someone had been making regularly on my LOC without my consent. I knew that I was not requesting any money because I do not know to access my account over the phone. After going into the bank and stopping this process the loan has steadily decreased. The major problem still exist : I paid off the loan and opened a loan with XXXX to pay off this loan. I am currently paying both loans. I understand that my loan with XXXX should be my only loan, but Wells Fargo loan is still open. I will not stop paying until the loan has been resolved through the courts to ensure that my property is not wrongfully taken because of default on a loan that has been paid off twice and it is still open. 
I have requested information from XXXX and they have provided me with written proof that the loan with Wells Fargo was paid off again in XXXX, XXXX and to this date I am still paying the loan with Wells Fargo and XXXX. 
I am requesting someone to help me stop this fraud that has persisted since XXXX, and to refund me all the overpayments to this account, pay off XXXX plus all interest paid, and remove all loans against my home and land.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,WELLS FARGO & COMPANY,SC,296XX,Older American,Consent provided,Web,07/27/23,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,7180072

02/01/23,"Payday loan, title loan, or personal loan",Installment loan,Getting the loan,None,"I decided to pursue a loan with BHG in XX/XX/2022. I took my time to consider it and during the next several weeks, the original advisor, XXXX, was changed to a different one. I spoke with her, XXXX, several times about the amount and the terms. I then decided to finalize the offer on XX/XX/XXXX. I replied to XXXX via email from my XXXX and did not receive a reply. I left a voice message and then spoke with her and she indicated she did not receive my email, and asked if I could email her from my computer. That sounded odd and I indicated that if I can I will, but that I am very busy with work and I routinely send emails - from the same address - from my phone. I then responded to subsequent emails from XXXX and the same thing happened. I asked her to please check her spam folder. After responding to a text to verify my identity with a photo of my ID and face, I was to be sent a link to the application, but the link in the email did not work. Specifically, it was a hyperlinked "" click here '' and although it highlighted when I hovered over it, it was not clickable, it did not open anything. I emailed XXXX about this and again she had the same odd issue saying she didn't receive my email. Nothing was wrong with my email, phone, or any device ; this was all on BHG. I called her to complain about the emails and also now about the inoperative link. She sent it again. Same thing happened. And then she said she would escalate it to IT. 

Throughout all of this, there was no way to contact IT myself, or to contact someone else. I was directed back to XXXX. Someone from IT, XXXX, called while I was in a meeting and left a voice message with his number on XX/XX/XXXX. I tried calling him back twice on XX/XX/XXXX and also told XXXX, and she said she would have him call me, but as of XXXXXXXX XXXX I have not heard from XXXX again. I also got a call from XXXX, who XXXX said is working with her, and that was to say that I if I submit missing or erroneous information that I would need to send a copy of a check. I indicated that there was nothing in error in my application, since I have not yet been able to get into the application due to the inoperative link. I did receive another link to change my password, and that worked as far as the password, but then on the next page was the process to enter my banking information. There was a box to click indicating my consent fot BHG to use a third party verification. But yet again, I could not check the box. I clicked in it several times and nothing happened. There was a "" refresh '' button on the page and when I clicked that I red "" error '' box appeared at the top of the page. Again, no way to enter the information. 

Being very frustrated at the inordinate amount of time this process is taking, and the lack of basic technology to simply provide a hyperlink so I can provide my banking information, I looked for a customer service number and asked to speak to XXXX 's supervisor. It turns out, or at least appears, that XXXX is her supervisor. I asked to speak to XXXX 's supervisor to escalate this to fix these simple steps. I spoke with someone named XXXX who said she would speak to IT to resolve this matter.

I sent a message to him via XXXX yesterday, XX/XX/XXXX, but never heard from him either ( as I mentioned, there is no way to contact someone to truly escalate an issue ). 

Although BHG claims to provide "" concierge service '' they have failed to respond to my situation, and seem to re-frame it as something I did or inputs that were erroneous.

On XX/XX/XXXX, I logged into my Mariner Finance account to make a payment. I had not had the funds until then to make my payment, which had become due on XX/XX/XXXX. When I attempted to make a payment, I received a pop-up message stating that my account was on restricted payments and it directed me to contact the branch. 
This is the same problem that initiated my decision to file a complaint with CFPB in XX/XX/XXXX. As I stated then, and still assert, Mariner Finance engages in customer intimidation tactics. What could be an acceptable reason for a business to not allow a customer to make a payment to their account other than them trying to force my account into a 30 day late status to negatively impact my credit standing. My plan was to make the payment on XX/XX/XXXX and make another payment on XX/XX/XXXX to bring the account fully current.

I knew that it was highly unlikely that she would not be in the office at that time, but wanted to immediately inform her of the challenge that I was facing with making my payment. I then also called XXXX, which was the number that XXXX XXXX had on her voice greeting to contact the customer relations team. Although that number directs callers to press 1 to make a payment, when I did it just left me on hold for several minutes before first stating that the office was closed and that I could leave a message.

In fact, he had me to log into my account at that time. Now, I am not crazy, I know what I experienced, and even provided screen shots, but it figured I'd save my energy for more worthwhile matters that going back and forth about that since the evidence that I had did not lie.

05/22/23,"Payday loan, title loan, or personal loan",Installment loan,Getting the loan,None,"On XX/XX/2023, I applied for a loan through Personify. Initially, I was told I was approved and a list of varying amounts was presented to me with different payment options. I selected the one I needed and continued on with my application. However, when I got to the part that verifies your banking account info - I hit submit after putting my banking info in and it just sat there with a circle spinning in the middle of the screen as if it were loading for about 3 to 5 minutes. 

Eventually I got an error message that appeared in the little XXXX XXXX box. After getting the error message I noticed there was an option to click a button on the screen labeled 'Need More Time '. Seeing as that was my only option and hoping that it would email me a link where I could continue on with my application- this is the option I selected. Almost immediately, I was emailed a link to continue with my application. After clicking on the link to try to continue with my application it asked for my last name and the last four of my social- which I entered and again was taken to the banking verification page where just said "" we are processing your data '' in the XXXX XXXX box again. However, this time there was a continue button I can click right in the middle of that message which led to yet again another error message when clicking.

After seeing the error message I called Personify and spoke to an agent on the phone who had told me that he was able to see my application was 90 % complete and advised me that he needed to speak to the tech department. 

A few moments later the agent returned to the phone and confirmed there had been a glitch with Personify 's system and therefore would not allow me to move further in the application process. I was told by the agent that I would be getting a Link via email once the glitch was fixed by IT that would allow me to continue with my application and verify my banking info. 


On Sunday XX/XX/2023, I attempted to log on to the link that was sent to me after clicking the need more time button after getting the error message and again I put my last name in and my social, but this time I noticed that the message above said something about how XXXX XXXX is proud to work with XXXX XXXX  XXXX and over XXXX other banks - yet there was nothing in the XXXX XXXX bank verification box this time. 

On Monday XX/XX/2023, I tried yet again to complete the application and this time it told me it had expired. I called Personify and spoke to an agent on the phone who told me that my loan request had been denied. I asked her how an incomplete application can be denied - an application that was incomplete due to a glitch on Personify 's end. She just kept apologizing and telling me I could reapply in 60 days on top of telling me that it was not Personify 's fault at the glitch happened.

This is absolutely Personify 's fault as your own IT company admitted it was a glitch on your end. Furthermore, I received a hard inquiry on my credit report for an application that was only 90 % complete but ultimately denied because of Personify 's error with this alleged glitch. From a legal standpoint, I could see this presenting a big problem for personify under the equal credit opportunity act because it seems more like my application was just flat out the night before I could apply all the way. The fact remains that personify made a decision on extending credit to a consumer, me, without having 100 % of the information they needed.

Therefore, I'm hereby requesting that this inquiry be removed from whichever credit bureau my report was pulled from - XXXX, XXXX, XXXX.",None,"Applied Data Finance, LLC",OH,453XX,None,Consent provided,Web,05/22/23,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,7011615

Tired of the shady billing practices mentioned in XXXX Complaint ID XXXX ( PDF export attached ), I paid off the loan in full on XX/XX/2023 in the amount of {$3400.00}. 

On my payment history I see that {$25.00} of the XX/XX/2023 payoff went to a non-sufficient fund fee dated as the SAME DAY AS the payoff transaction. The payoff transaction on XX/XX/2023 was SUCCESSFUL, so all NSF fees associated with a SUCCESSFUL transaction on XX/XX/2023 are inaccurate. Again, the loan payoff transaction in the amount of {$3400.00} on XX/XX/2023 was SUCCESSFUL, yet {$25.00} of the {$3400.00} payment amount went to an NSF fee. A successful transaction predicates that all required account information needed to successfully complete the transaction, such as a routing numbers, etc., ARE CORRECT. I am entitled to a {$25.00} refund for this fee. 

Westlake Portfolio Management has not addressed this issue in my previous Complaint ID XXXX. Why was {$25.00} of my SUCCESSFUL {$3400.00} loan payoff transaction on XX/XX/2023 applied to an NSF fee? Where did this fee come from? Let me guessthis NSF fee is also from yet another conveniently untraceable attempt by Westlake Portfolio Management to debit my account? If so, please provide the date of and reason for this failed attempt made by Westlake Portfolio Management. Please be advised that Westlake Portfolio Management has never been authorized to debit my account at any time other than on a payment due date or if I as the customer initiates a payment. These sporadic, unauthorized payment attempts are another point in this complaint. My bank account was repeatedly accessed/attempted to be accessed on several occasions without my consent. 

The company knows these transactions are invalid but if I hadnt advocated for myself via several hours spent on the phone with their incompetent support call center, nothing would have been done. On XX/XX/203 Westlake Portfolio Management agreed to waive the fraudulent NSF fee from XX/XX/2023. To this day, XX/XX/2023, they have not honored this written agreement. The NSF fee from XX/XX/2023 has NOT BEEN WAIVED ; it is accruing interest on my account and just today, XX/XX/2023 I received an email titled You Have A Payment Due. The current balance, with interest, is {$28.00}. I am entitled to having this balance waived in its entirety. I should not and will not pay interest on an invalid fee that shouldnt have been assessed to begin with, not to mention the fact of interest accrual shows the extreme slowness and lack of urgency with which Westlake Portfolio Management responds to customers problems THEY CAUSED.

This matter was video recorded and the evidence can be submitted per request. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX I went to a different First Cash location in order to avoid interacting with the staff at the XXXX XXXX XXXX who have an active complaint both with CFPB and with First Cash, the company. I perceived that perhaps, I would be interacted with differently at this location. The exact opposite occurred. 

I requested two things : 1. to receive a print out of my account history which they provided and 2. asked them if they would be interested to either purchase or provide a loan for a bike. This bike is one I had purchased from them over a year ago, sold back to them, and purchased it again. The original location of this bike was the pawn store so this is not an item that should be under any question of my ownership. 

Unfortunately, XXXX, the same individual who was at the other store location, was working at this store. He walked outside with me to look at the bike, recognized it from being in their inventory, and said "" I recognize this. I know its from our store. Odd comment to make. He said that "" because you are investigating us and made complaints about us, I can't give you a loan or buy this bike '' I replied "" really? '' XXXX said he would need to contact his district manager and ask her how she wanted him to proceed but because I complained, they are not able to give me a loan or buy the bike. 

XXXX 's statement "" because you complained '' as the reason for denying a loan to me falls under clear retaliation. He did not cite any other reason for denying the loan or the sale of the bike back to them. He reiterated this once we were back in the store in front of other customers denying me of my privacy and causing further embarrassment of this completely inappropriate conversation and comments.

05/20/23,"Payday loan, title loan, or personal loan",Installment loan,Charged fees or interest you didn't expect,None,"We applied for a personal Loan at One Main Financial at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX WA XXXX. When we first sat down with the loan officer, she asked what we needed the loan for and we answered by renovating our kitchen. We carried on some small talk and got down to business.

I began by asking some questions. I asked if there was a loan origination fee. She answered no. I asked if there was an early payoff penalty or fee. She answered No. When looking at my husbands credit score she remarked that it was quite high, she wasnt used to seeing such a high credit score. I continued asking questions as we continued the process. When it came time to complete the paperwork, I handed her my drivers license and she remarked that I will just put this in your husbands name. No sense in complicating things.

When it came time to sign for the loan, she handed my husband an IPad with the loan information. He said, it went from place to sign to the next place to sign. He wasnt able to read the paperwork. He turns XXXX in XXXX and I think he had difficulty with the small font. We are used to signing loan documents on paper. 
We received our first payment notice. It was considerably higher than the agreed upon payment. My husband called and was told that the increase in payment was due to accrued interest from the time we signed for the loan and the time of the first payment. We were asked when we wanted to make the first payment so we chose a date. Never in our life, in all of the loans that we have signed for, have we had to pay interest from the signing of the loan to the first payment. The loan officer did not tell us about it and I had never heard of it so I didnt ask about it. ( When my husband called to ask about it, her response was that It was in the contract on the IPad. ) My husband usually opens the bills so I have not had an opportunity to look at any statements until the third statement that we received. I noticed we owed more than we had borrowed. I called and was told that it was a loan origination fee. ( The Loan officer had lied to me. ) It has become obvious to me why the loan XXXX did not want me to sign. I was asking questions. My husband is almost XXXX and can get confused. He was quiet and asked nothing. He was an easy mark. I realize that more than likely this borders on the line of legality especially since it is our word against the loan officer that she lied to us. The printer was down so she couldnt give us a copy of the contract. She never said she would mail it to us. We never got a copy of the paperwork. 
We took out a personal loan at XXXX for the remaining amount of money we needed for our kitchen. There was no origination fee, and no charge or interest before our first payment, and I can believe the loan officer at XXXX that there will be no early pay off penalty. We plan to pay off both loans in the beginning of XXXX when we are able to liquidate some funds. I will be very angry if we have to pay an early payoff penalty. 
We were lied to by the loan officer. She told me that there was no origination fee. She never mentioned that we would have to pay interest between when we signed for the loan and our first payment. She targeted my husband as the person to borrow the money not both of us. We have always had joint financial obligations. To me this is slimy business operating procedures. If there is smoke there is fire and there is plenty of smoke in our dealing with XXXX XXXX. Illegal? I dont know. Unethical targeting seniors possibly, but the entire transaction gives me a bad taste in my mouth. Despite obscene interest rates, they also prey on the poor, uneducated or those struggling financially that have no place to go.

I move on with life and I get another xall from another rep who begins harassing me abkut how I need to make a payment right now or defer right now. I tell her I already have one scheduled and she says it doesn't matter, I need to either make a payment right now or defer right now. I insist I habe one scheduled and how does it not matter when another rep scheduled it with me prior? She said it's not ok to be late and if I don't pay or defer then she is going to have to have the branch manager call me. And I said fine because it isn't ok to tell a consumer a payment is ok and then lie about it and harass them for more. The branch manager never called me so I pa icked and went online and coukdnt see a scheduled payment. I made an immediate payment for what was due, all of it, {$600.00} and some change. Well two days later I get hut for over {$1200.00} off my account. I had actually had kne scheduled but they did it for the XXXX and I never would ever request the XXXX. So I start trying to get the double payment back and the rep tells me they won't give it back because XXXX is next week basically. Now that is two {$600.00} payments in one month .... why did I get charged late fees twice? I should get one late fee back as it isn't XXXX, so XXXX isn't late. They refuse. I file a complaint with XXXX and on complaim on their XXXX. I get a call today and they say sure we will give the extra payment back, no problem, but you need to send us a current bank statement or we CANT. I ask if this is law or internal policy, they say internal policy. So they are holding a double payment, that they are not entitled too, plus a late fee they also are not entitled to, for an internal policy that does NOT trump state or federal laws ablut refunds and extra payments or payments taken on wrong days. I asked for a waiver since they can clearly see in their system that they took two payments in one month, and he admitted he can see it but that they can not return my money back to me, because their company invented a malicious internal policy to make consumers XXXX through hoops for refunds they are legally entitled to.",None,OneMain Finance Corporation,TX,782XX,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,06/29/23,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,7193066

I entered into a loan agreement with the company with an initial principal amount of {$20000.00} and an interest rate of 9.99 %. Despite making timely payments, I have encountered a concerning issue wherein my principal balance has been steadily increasing since the initiation of the loan.

To date, I have made all payments promptly and have never exceeded the due date. Furthermore, I have taken the initiative to make early payments, demonstrating my commitment to fulfilling my financial obligations responsibly. Despite these efforts, my principal balance has inexplicably reached an alarming high of {$20000.00}. This indicates that my payments have been consistently applied towards interest alone, while the principal balance remains untouched.

This issue is not unique to my situation, as similar complaints have been reported by consumers. This pattern suggests a systemic problem within Service Finance Company 's loan servicing practices, warranting immediate attention and intervention from regulatory bodies such as yours.

I kindly request that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau launch an investigation into the practices of Service Finance Company to ascertain the reasons behind this alarming discrepancy. I believe that such an inquiry is necessary to protect consumers from potential predatory lending practices and ensure compliance with fair lending standards.

I have attached copies of all relevant documentation, including my loan agreement, payment receipts, and any correspondence exchanged wit

h Service Finance Company. These documents should serve as evidence supporting my claim and aid in your investigation.

I appreciate your prompt attention to this matter, as it directly affects my financial well-being and raises concerns about the integrity of Service Finance Company 's lending operations.

03/24/23,"Payday loan, title loan, or personal loan",Title loan,Vehicle was repossessed or sold the vehicle,None,"I am would like to file a formal complaint against XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX dba LoanMart located at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, CA XXXX My account number is XXXX I am sitting and writing this in tears because this company sucked all life out of me since XX/XX/XXXX and today they repossessed my car again because I simply can not make these payments any more. 

Out of desperation I took out a loan with LoanMart in XX/XX/XXXX for the amount of {$8800.00} to which they have added a prepaid finance charge or so-called admin fee of {$950.00}. They gave me this loan at the interest rate of 105.72 %. Each payment was to be {$780.00} My plan was to pay it off quickly, but due to personal circumstances this did not happen no matter how hard I tried and with increasing loan amount it became harder and harder to pay it off. 

Below are my complaints against LoanMart ( and these are the main complaints, I could talk about their rude and dismissive customer service for hours. For the amount of money we pay them, they should at least treat us with respect and without threats! ) : First of all, on XX/XX/XXXX a new California law went into effect that now caps the maximum interest rate on loans issued by certified finance lenders. LoanMart is such a lender. 

That law ( California Financial Code 22304.5 ) went into effect on XX/XX/XXXX - https : //leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml? lawCode=FIN & sectionNum=22304.5. 

Under that law, the maximum interest rate on loans from {$2500.00} to {$9900.00} is 36 %, plus the federal funds rate. This means that a maximum interest rate should be about 36.25 % to 38.5 %. There are related laws that invalidate loans that exceed those interest rates - https : //leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml? lawCode=FIN & sectionNum=22750. 

And there is a class action lawsuit against LoanMart that is going on at the moment for that same reason - that they ignored that new law ( California XXXX XXXX XXXX ) and continued issuing loans with high interests rates. The lawsuit is between XXXX XXXX XXXX Wheels Financial Group , LLC . There are tons of complaints about this just on this site. 

The Department of Financial Protection & Innovation also launched an investigation into evasion of Californias new interest rate caps by LoanMart and confirmed that LoanMart ( although working with a bank in Utah ) is not allowed to charge above 36 % as permitted by new California law. 

Do you think I was informed by Loanmart about this change in the law? No. They did not reach out to me in XX/XX/XXXX to recalculate the interest on my loan. I did not know about this until early XXXX last year, until I started actively doing my own research. 

I tried to call and talk to a customer service representative about lowering my interest rate last year in XXXX and they said they do not know anything about this new law and can not help me. 

Now, lets do some math here. 

In XXXX Ive made 12 payments totaling- {$9300.00} and at the end of the year I owed them as much - {$9300.00}. 

The new law was introduced in XX/XX/XXXX, my interest rate should have been no more than 36 %. Even if my interest rate was 36 % starting from XX/XX/XXXX, then I would only need to pay additional {$3300.00} in XXXX and {$13000.00} over the remaining 48 months. 

However, from XX/XX/XXXX until XX/XX/XXXX ( for 3 years without knowing about the new law! ) I continued to pay 105.72 % and have paid LoanMart over {$21000.00} ( Ive made 27 payments as I was able to get deferment from them every 3 months or so as this loan was extremely expensive and I could not afford these payments ). 

In addition, they repossessed my car in XX/XX/XXXX and in XX/XX/XXXX because I was late on my payment ( a little over 30 days late ) and I had to pay over {$500.00} in additional fees each time to get my car back from the lot. I actually had to pay an additional {$75.00} to just get my car released last year! Can you believe this? Do you think money is falling to me from the sky? If it was, I would not be getting a title loan in the first place! 

My car was towed away again last night. 

Now that I have overpaid for the last 3 years, I do not owe LoanMart anything, and I own my car! I demand my car back and additional {$8700.00} back - this is the money that I overpaid and I also want get paid for the emotional distress you caused me- for these 3 times that youve made me so stressed over losing my car! 

2. I did receive 4 emails recently when ( I could not make payments any more ) offering to refinance this amount {$9700.00} at 51 %! 

51 % is illegal in California since XX/XX/XXXX according to the California Financial Code 22304.5. But they still are doing this! They are still offering loans at 51 %! When will this stop? Even with all these laws and restrictions in place, they continue to scam people out of money! 

In addition, which ( and please, look closely at what they are doing ) : {$9700.00} - this is NOT even my initial loan amount! This amount includes the administration fee of {$950.00}! So, not only they still believe I owe them the full loan amount, they are still adding that administrative fee on top of it and continue calculating interest on it! Since when do we pay interest on administrative fees? They pretend like this is my actual initial loan amount! 

3. They also broke the law by contacting people Ive mentioned on my initial title loan application as references in XX/XX/XXXX discussing my loan with them. All 4 references. I felt so embarrassed that people I left as references were bothered by this! This is also illegal in California. 

Just recently in XXXX they called my friend. I have a screenshot of their call that my friend shared with me. I assume again they called all 4 people that I left as references on my application! 

When I was applying for this loan, I was assured they will not call them that that was just a formality. 

4. They call twice and sometimes 3 times a day, which is also illegal in California. I have screenshots of their phone numbers. And they do call from 2-3 different numbers when they call several times a day. And this is on top of sending emails. Creditors may not call us more than 7 times within 7 consecutive days or call us within 7 days of talking to me about the debt. Everything outside of this is creditor harassment, is illegal and Im adding this to my case. 

5. Finally, the customer service in addition to being rude and dismissive just could not get rid of the {$10.00} late fees on my account! Although, I paid the full amount plus the additional {$10.00} late fee, these {$10.00} late fees still stayed on my account. I could see them every time I log into my account online. And one of the customer service representatives even told me I should pay them! Just look at the monthly payments I had made- they included the {$10.00} fee when I was late. They are so incompetent! 

If they can't see that I had already paid the late fee, and they can't differentiate between the actual loan amount and the administrative fee, they do not listen to the California Government and continue offering people high interest rate loans- how can we trust this company? Why are they still in business? 

I could go on and on about how I felt abused by this company, but the bottom line is that today they towed my car again. The car that I own at this point according to the new California law. 

They owe me at least {$8700.00}, plus the late fees ( they made me pay for the amount I did not owe them any more since I overpaid a long time ago without knowing ), and the stress, migraines and inconvenience they caused when they towed my car these 3 times. 

I demand my car, my car title, and {$8700.00} at your earliest convenience or I will take other measures that I have already discussed with my attorney.",None,"WHEELS FINANCIAL GROUP, LLC.",CA,91761,None,Consent provided,Web,04/26/23,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,6747144

The representative I spoke to over the phone, right away pointed me to language in the loan agreement about the CAB fee not being interest ( which is the only place it appears ) which means two things : first, they get this complaint all the time, and secondly, they know their advertising and website to be misleading.

01/16/23,"Payday loan, title loan, or personal loan",Installment loan,Charged fees or interest you didn't expect,None,"This complaint is against the predatory and unconscionable billing practices by Yamaha Motor Finance Corporation. I note from your online Consumer Complaint Database that you have had hundreds of complaints lodged against Yamaha Finance. 

As background, in early XXXX I bought a new Yamaha XXXX Boat at the XXXX Boat Show. The dealer offered me no hassle financing through Yamaha Motor Finance Corporation, which I accepted. In XX/XX/XXXX I placed the monthly payments on my XXXX XXXX Bill Pay feature. The first payment for XX/XX/XXXX of {$260.00} was timely paid. All additional monthly payments between XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX were received by Yamaha either before the due date or within the grace period. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a phone call from a Yamaha representative who stated they had not received my XXXX payment, and a late fee of {$39.00} was due. I explained to him that I was departing on a short vacation the very next morning, and I would look into the matter when I returned. Upon my return I checked my XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX history to determine what happened. I checked back for XXXX ( XXXX ) months prior to XXXX, and all the XXXX XXXX payments were received by Yamaha either before the XXXX of the month, or within the grace period. The XXXX payment was processed by Yamaha on Monday, XX/XX/XXXX. However, I strongly believe, based upon the 2 year payment history, that the check was received in Yamahas post office box on either Friday, XX/XX/XXXX or Saturday, XX/XX/XXXX, within the grace period, but it was not processed by their employees those days. 

On return from my trip, my mail contained the bill from Yamaha for XXXX wherein they assessed me {$79.00} in late fees- for what the extra {$39.00} was added I didnt know. On XX/XX/XXXX I typed a letter to Yamaha explaining the circumstances, and mailed it to them. I requested they waive the late fee based on my excellent payment record for 2 years, however I never received any acknowledgment or response from them. 

Thus, on XX/XX/XXXX, I called Yamaha and spoke to a representative named XXXX. He told me that I now owed {$110.00} in late fees! I was furious and asked to speak with a supervisor. I was connected to a lady named XXXX. She alleged that they searched my record and found another late payment in early XXXX, [ but I was never notified of it, nor did they ever include it in their monthly bills ]. In order to save further time and expense, I offered to pay her the {$39.00} for the payment that was processed by Yamaha on XX/XX/XXXX, however she would not accept my offer. Instead, she demanded the entire alleged amount. That is when I decided to file this complaint with CFPB. Note that I changed my XXXX XXXX Bill Pay order so that all future payments by XXXX XXXX will be sent out on the XXXX of the month instead of the XXXX, to ensure that possible slow postal service could no longer result in a late payment. 

Then I went online to the Yamaha website and discovered what they had done. When my payment for XX/XX/XXXX was received by Yamaha on XX/XX/XXXX, they first took out the late payment from XX/XX/XXXX, then alleged that my payment for XXXX was not in the full amount, so they assessed another late fee for XXXX [ even though the payment was received early and they knew I was disputing the first late fee ]. Presumably, Yamaha wants to continue this improper and usurious accounting method until they can allege that I owe them a XXXX dollars in late fees and additional interest! 

Therefore, I restate my position that I am willing to pay Yamaha {$39.00} for the late fee they charged me on XX/XX/XXXX, providing that they cancel all other late fees and extra interest that have been or will be assessed due to alleged late payments that occurred during XXXX. I also seek agreement that they will not attempt to damage my credit rating over this dispute. Any assistance the CFPB can give me in this regard will be greatly appreciated.

I have made multiple attempts to resolve this issue directly with the credit reporting agency to no avail. As a result, I kindly request your intervention and assistance in addressing this matter by the provisions outlined in 15 USC 1692, 15 USC 1681, and their respective subsections.

However, the credit reporting agency in question has persistently failed to correct inaccurate information on my credit report, as required by 15 USC 1681 ( e ).

Furthermore, the credit reporting agency 's actions may also violate the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( 15 USC 1681 ). The sections that are pertinent to my case are as follows : 1. 15 USC 1681 ( e ) : Compliance with reasonable procedures to assure maximum possible accuracy of consumer report information.

2. 15 USC 1681 ( s ) ( 2 ) : Duties of furnishers of information to consumer reporting agencies.

4. 15 USC 1681 ( i ) ( 5 ) : Procedures for handling consumer disputes.

Despite my repeated attempts to rectify the inaccuracies through direct communication with the credit reporting agency, they have failed to take appropriate action. Therefore, I am seeking your intervention to ensure that the agency complies with its legal obligations under the aforementioned statutes and rectifies the inaccurate reporting.

I kindly request that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau undertake a thorough investigation into this matter and use its authority to compel the credit reporting agency to delete the inaccurate reporting from my credit file. Additionally, I would appreciate any assistance you can provide in facilitating the resolution of this issue, which has had severe implications on my financial standing and overall well-being.

Enclosed with this letter, please find copies of relevant documentation, including correspondence with the credit reporting agency and any supporting evidence that substantiates my claim. I believe this evidence will further emphasize the urgency and importance of addressing this matter promptly.

I appreciate your attention to this matter and I am confident in the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau 's commitment to protecting consumer rights. I kindly request that you acknowledge receipt of this letter and provide me with an update on the status of my complaint. Should you require any additional information or documentation, please do not hesitate to contact me at the address provided above or via email at XXXX.

I am deeply concerned about their unfair and deceptive billing practices that have had a significant impact on my financial well-being. 

Description of the Issue : On XX/XX/2020, I opened an account with CreditFresh, for a line of credit. Since then, I have consistently made timely payments as required by the terms of the agreement. However, I have repeatedly encountered unjustified and exorbitant "" Billing Cycle Charges '' that are added to my account on a regular basis. These "" Billing Cycle Charges '' are not adequately explained and are based on a complex formula related to the outstanding principal balance. Despite numerous attempts to seek clarification from CreditFresh, I have not received satisfactory explanations for the imposition of these charges. The lack of transparency and justification for these fees is deeply concerning. My attempts to communicate my concerns with CreditFresh have been met with evasive responses and attempts to deflect the issue. Furthermore, their customer service representatives have provided inconsistent and unsatisfactory explanations for these charges, leaving me feeling frustrated and exploited. Actions Taken : I have sent multiple emails to CreditFresh, expressing my concerns about the unfair "" Billing Cycle Charges '' and requesting detailed explanations for their imposition. I have received responses from CreditFresh that attempt to rationalize these charges but fail to provide a clear and transparent explanation for their calculation. I have requested that these charges be removed or substantially reduced, as they constitute an undue financial burden and are not adequately justified. I have expressed my intention to close my account with CreditFresh if these unfair billing practices are not rectified. I have taken the necessary steps to protect my rights as a consumer by seeking clarification, advocating for fair treatment, and attempting to engage CreditFresh in resolving this issue. However, the lack of appropriate responses and actions from CreditFresh has left me with no choice but to escalate this matter. I am sharing this complaint with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau in the hope that appropriate action will be taken to investigate CreditFresh 's unfair billing practices. I believe that these practices not only harm individual consumers like myself but also undermine the principles of transparency, fairness, and ethical conduct within the financial industry. I kindly request that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau initiate an investigation into CreditFresh 's billing practices to ensure that consumers are treated fairly and that deceptive practices are addressed promptly.

02/20/23,"Payday loan, title loan, or personal loan",Installment loan,Problem when making payments,None,"Mariner Finance purposely blocked my ability to make payments online with guaranteed funds which caused default and sending my account to collections. This account should not be in collections office because Mariner forced this situation due to unfair practices and it appears that the company is purposely attempting to injure my credit. Over the course of the last 45 days, I tried several times to pay online with my debit card. The online system blocked that ability even though I had tried to pay the total amount due. I was out of town working remote from XX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/XXXX. During the time that I was working remote, I was unable to call in to make a payment over the phone as requested during business hours because I was unavailable via phone because of work obligations. I wouldve made payments with a debit card online using my account log in if I was allowed by the online system. I have made payments online in the past and should still be allowed to with guaranteed funds. 

I was not available during Mariners business hours therefore I could not talk to them to process a payment over the phone. However, I would have made several payments online had I been allowed to do so with my DEBIT card. I was attempting to make the online payment so that Mariner would be able to credit my account immediately. 

My work hours and unavailability did not make it convenient for me to have a phone conversation. I tried a few times to call the office during my lunch breaks but the calls went to voicemail. Since I wasnt in town, I was not able to drop off a money order payment to the office location near me. I tried to call on my lunch break when available, but, I was not able to get connected because Mariners phone system went to voicemail. I have attached toll transactions proving that I was out of state on the dates indicated above. 

It is my concern that Mariner is unfairly attempting to garnish my wages when they blocked me from paying with guaranteed funds via the online system. I am very concerned about the practices of Mariner finance. They have sent me a judgement letter to sign and I do not believe this is fair to me as the consumer given the practices of Mariner finance detailed above.

01/07/23,"Payday loan, title loan, or personal loan",Personal line of credit,Charged fees or interest you didn't expect,None,"1. I believe that Truist Bank has charged me double interest under my equity line of credit for the same monies during the same period in different accounts. 

I have tried to get a clarification of the bases/rationale for each interest assessment ( since the rational/bases is not written anywhere ), to no avail. 

Specifically, Truists XXXX statement shows that the interest due amount for Equity Line account A is {$1000.00}. While the interest due amount under Equity Line account B is {$750.00} for the exact same money and the exact same period. That equates to {$1800.00} in INTEREST for the same monies during the exact time period! 

I seek a full review of this matter. I seek a clear explanation in plain language of the bases of these concurrent interest amounts, inclusive of the time period of both interest calculations. I seek a bill reflective of a fair and just interest due amount. 

2. Truists Errors, Inquiries, and Disputed Policy outlines that the customer does not have to pay any amount in question while Truist is investigating, emphasizing that the customer is still obligated to pay the parts of the customers statement that are not in question. And, that while Truist is investigating the customers question, Truist can not report the customer as delinquent or take any action to collect the amount the customer questions. 

Nevertheless, while I have done my part ; Truist has not. I initiated concerns about this dispute the moment I received XXXX XX/XX/2022 statement up through this very day. Yet Truist has initiated delinquent action against me via the national credit system and I have been continuously bombarded with harassing calls from collectors.

I seek to have Truist compelled to honor its Errors, Inquiries, and Disputed Policy thereby ensuring that my credit record is void of all of the delinquent entries in this matter and that the harassing calls cease until this matter is resolved. 


Background On XX/XX/2022, I initiated a written request ( following an onsite verbal request ) to "" fix '' the interest rate on the draw portion of my equity line of credit account A. 

On XX/XX/XXXX Truist advised that while the final terms were not entirely completed, Truist could offer a "" fixed '' interest rate on the draw portion on my equity line. 

Since I had heard nothing back from Truist by XX/XX/XXXX, I called Truist. 
Truist got back with me on XX/XX/XXXX and on XX/XX/XXXX advised that the offer of the fixed rate would be on a XXXX ( XXXX ) mortgage versus my then XXXX ( XXXX ) credit line. And, if I was agreeable to that time period Truist could fix the interest rate on my draw ( account A ) to 4.9 %. Additionally Truist advised that the monthly payment would be either {$1000.00} or {$1500.00}. I accepted the offer over the telephone. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I received Truist XX/XX/XXXX Equity Line statement which showed XXXX amounts due -- {$1000.00} and {$1500.00}, -- a total of {$2.00}, XXXX. As such, I immediately contacted Truist about the conflict ( verbally and via email ). 
( See XX/XX/XXXX XXXX attached/available to submit ) Truist responded on XX/XX/XXXX indicating receipt of my inquiry and advising that the inquiry would be forward to the loan department for an explanation. In discussion, I indicated I would pay the higher figure while the conflict was being reviewed. 

Having heard nothing back from Truist during XXXX, I called, as well as, emailed Truist on XX/XX/XXXX to follow-up on getting a better understanding of the bases for each of apparent duplicative accrued interest assessments. 
On XX/XX/XXXX Truist wrote via email : Good morning XXXX XXXX, Sorry for the delayed response, I was out of the office at the end of last week in meetings. It looks like the change in interest payment was due to a change in the interest rate. On your XXXX statement your annual percentage rate was 4.71 %. The total finance charges in XXXX were {$910.00}. In XXXX your annual percentage rate was 5.46 % and your total finance charges were {$1000.00}. Let me know if this answers your question, if not, we can definitely discuss further. 

All the best! 

Regards, ( See log/content of emails attached/available to submit ) This response was entirely unclear to me because, among other things, it did not answer why I was being charged interest concurrently for the same monies during the same period in different accounts. 
( See XX/XX/XXXX Statement attached/available to submit ) As such, I called Truist and the response ( after a lengthy discussion ) was the same response as the above written message -- just in different words. 

Given the conflict, I was referred up the ladder to the Loan Department. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I ultimately spoke with a Loan Supervisor/Manager who after a lengthy discussion explained that my XX/XX/XXXX payment ( which I paid online ) was paid to the new equity line of credit ( account B ) versus the original equity line of credit. 

The supervisor/manager advised that he would process a correction so that those interest monies ( {$750.00} ) paid to the new equity line ( account "" B '' ) were applied to the original equity line of credit ( account A ) interest due amount. 

This correction sounded reasonable to me because it seemingly assessed a portion of the interest charges under XXXX account for a certain portion of the month and assessed a portion of the interest charges under the other account for the remaining or other portion of the month. This would correct the apparent duplicative interest assessment, and thereby significantly reduce the total amount of interest due. 

However, upon receiving the XX/XX/XXXX statement on XX/XX/XXXX it continued to show the XXXX amounts due -- {$1000.00} and {$1500.00}, -- a total of {$2.00}, XXXX. The statement further showed bogus adjustments/corrections. The adjustments/corrections made by the supervisor/manager are bogus because each reversal was reapplied in the same amount, to the same account, on the exact same day in the form of a payment. 
( See XX/XX/XXXX Statement attached/available to submit I contact the supervisor/manager on XX/XX/XXXX and was told that nothing more could be done, no further explanation was available and no more adjustments would be made to my account. The supervisor/manager could not explain the rationale/impact of the adjustments/corrections that he made. 
( See XXXX Spreadsheet of equity line transactions attached ) I have requested of the supervisor/manager ( XXXX XXXX ) and a loan officer ( XXXX ) to initiate an internal dispute relative to this matter. I also mailed in and hand delivered written letters of dispute. 
( See Letters of Dispute attached/available to submit ) During this period I have received calls from Truist Collections relative to this matter. I have repeatedly advised Truist Collections that the matter is in dispute, to no avail. The calls keep coming. 

Moreover, Truist has initiated delinquent action against me via the national credit system, as well as, issued a temporary suspension of credit. I have been a customer at this bank for over XXXX decades without a single delinquency or issue. 

Truists Errors, Inquiries, and Disputed Policy outlines that the customer does not have to pay any amount in question while Truist is investigating the matter. The policy emphasizes that the customer is still obligated to pay the parts of the customers statement that are not in question. And, that while Truist is investigating the customers question, Truist can not report the customer as delinquent or take any action to collect the amount the customer questions.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,TRUIST FINANCIAL CORPORATION,VA,235XX,None,Consent provided,Web,01/07/23,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,6408663

Despite my repeated attempts to address these concerns directly with Sezzle, I have not received a satisfactory resolution, which has led me to escalate the matter to your esteemed organization.

Since becoming a Sezzle Anywhere Member, I have been experiencing significant problems related to my spending power. On multiple occasions, I have contacted Sezzle 's support team seeking assistance, specifically on XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX. Despite my efforts, the issues remain unresolved, causing considerable frustration and inconvenience. 

One of the primary concerns is the consistent and unwarranted decrease in my spending limit without any valid explanation. On XX/XX/XXXX, my spending limit was reduced from {$400.00} to {$250.00}, and more recently, on XX/XX/XXXX, it was further reduced to {$200.00}. It is important to note that I have maintained a perfect payment history, hold a paid Sezzle Anywhere Membership, and have frequently made early payoffs. As a loyal customer and a subscriber to the Premium Membership, I firmly believe that I should be entitled to spending power increases rather than decreases. 

These unexplained and arbitrary reductions in my spending power have severely impacted my ability to make necessary purchases through the Sezzle platform, thereby undermining the value and convenience of the services provided. Despite my attempts to seek assistance from Sezzle 's customer support team, their responses have been inadequate, offering no reasonable explanation or resolution to rectify the situation. This lack of effective support has left me feeling helpless and dissatisfied with the level of service provided.

As a resolution to this ongoing issue, I kindly request the following actions to be taken by Sezzle : 1 ) An immediate increase in my spending power to a minimum of {$1000.00}, allowing for the necessary purchases and compensating for the arbitrary reductions previously imposed. 
2 ) Implementation of measures to safeguard my account from unwarranted decreases in spending power, ensuring a consistent and reliable user experience. 
3 ) A complimentary 1-year Sezzle Anywhere Membership as a gesture of goodwill for the inconvenience, frustration, and lack of adequate support experienced throughout this process. 

These requested actions are fair and reasonable given my demonstrated responsibility as a customer, my commitment to utilizing Sezzle 's services responsibly, and my status as a Premium Membership subscriber. By addressing these concerns, Sezzle can uphold its commitment to providing a fair and transparent marketplace for its customers.

Should Sezzle fail to address these concerns and provide a satisfactory resolution, I kindly request the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to intervene in this matter and take appropriate action to protect consumers from unfair practices, ensure regulatory compliance, and maintain the integrity of the financial services industry. 

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I trust in the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau 's commitment to consumer rights and their dedication to fostering a fair and transparent marketplace.

05/15/23,"Payday loan, title loan, or personal loan",Installment loan,Getting the loan,None,"On XX/XX/XXXX I submitted complain XXXX which has since been ineffectively handled and closed. 

I would like to express my disappointment and frustration with the lack of attention and support provided by Wells Fargo in regards to my loan application and subsequent complaint. I was relying on this loan to support my goals and prevent hardship. Because of the denial, i am in the midst of a financial crisis. 

In XXXX of XXXX, I was offered loan rates up to {$100000.00} through wells fargos website when I was checked my rate for a personal loans, I decided not to move forward at that time. HoweverXXXX XXXX months later it became apparent that i would need money to get myself through a transition that would improve my position, or I was going to be in a bad situation. I checked my rate again and was denied. The reason I was given by Wells fargos representative was my high debt and account delinquency. Those are not new, they were on my credit report back in XXXX when i had been approved. Those negative marks resulted from a personal crisis that perpetuated into a financial crisis. My credit card debt should not have been a considerstion since XXXX purpose for my loan request was to pay off all my balances. I also explained to the XXXX representative that I was a party in XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX and that my XXXX in student loan debt would soon be forgiven in full. The representative informed me that Wells Fargo only considers what is current on my credit report. Which, goes against the guidance of the cfpb, to consider additional factors and not solely the credit report. 

After I submitted my complaint to the cfpb, I missed a call from XXXX at wells fargo XXXX office. I attempted to contact her back twice and was told by another representative that there was no need for her to talk to me, my complaint was being investigated and I would be informed of a decision in XXXX  days. Instead, Wells Fargo informed the cfpb that they needed XXXX  days to address my concerns. 

it is unacceptable that Wells Fargo would need the additional time to address my concerns as stated in the recent letter. No attempt has been made to listen to my concerns and they still have not been addressed. I believe it is the responsibility of Wells Fargo to provide timely responses and support to customers in need, especially during times of financial hardship. I didn't have this long and their refusal to listen or help has only caused things to get worse.In this moment, had I been approved by Wells Fargo, I would have had my credit debt paid off and a higher credit score, I would have the licenses, leads and equipment needed for my new contracting opportunity, a space to work out of to do hypnosis, and my non profit would be formed and ready to go. I would be generating an income.. Instead I'm maxed out on my cards, my score is going down I havent met my obligations I have no income coming in and don't know how I'm going to pay my bills. I'm going to lose an opportunity and the amount of funding I now need to compensate for the damage is XXXX instead of the original XXXX I requested. It is unconscionable that Wells Fargo responded to my complaint and denied my loan with the inclusion of the recent negative information on my credit report that only resulted from my inability to get the loan I needed to prevent the problem from happening. 

I would like to bring to your attention the Fair Credit Reporting Act and the Equal Credit Opportunity Act which prohibit discrimination in lending based on XXXX  XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX, or receipt of public assistance. By denying my loan application based on my current credit report and not taking into account my imminent student loan forgiveness, Wells Fargo may be violating these laws. Wells fargo did not give me fair consideration if they only looked at my credit report. It may seem universally fair to apply the same standard to the entire population but it's XXXX percent discriminatory and it only results in exclusion of populations like myself because as a single parent who receives no child support and has noone to turn to for help, the expectation that I meet the same criteria as someone who has a partner, support and people to turn to for help, is completely unrealistic. 

In the last XXXX  years I have had a baby, separated from the father who was cheating. I've been hospitalized for an illness that almost killed me. My XXXX XXXX The pandemic happened. I was stuck home assisting my XXXX with school online for a year because he has a learning XXXX. My job and income were negatively impacted by the pandemic and never improved and everything has become more expensive. I got through all of that by myself. All of those things are financial stressors. When I applied in XXXX, the fact that I had a XXXX was an achievement. if anything it demonstrates resiliency. Thats reality. 


I am also aware that Wells Fargo has a responsibility to prevent poverty and promote economic inclusion as outlined in the Community Reinvestment Act. As a long-time customer of Wells Fargo with a credit card and a checking account, it is disappointing that I am unable to obtain a loan from a bank that has been able to lend out XXXX dollars for every XXXX dollar I have deposited into my account since i opened it. 

I understand that I am considered socioeconomically disadvantaged and vulnerable because I am a minority and single parent. I don't I don't have access to resources. I understand that I'm perceived as a risk, however in consideration to the recession and current state of the countries monetary system, I am just as much of a risk as anyone else.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,WELLS FARGO & COMPANY,NV,89145,None,Consent provided,Web,05/15/23,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,6980116

I called to ask why and they informed me that I had only been refinancing the loan every month and none of what I was paying was going towards the balance. Would have been nice to know that up front.

05/31/23,"Payday loan, title loan, or personal loan",Personal line of credit,Charged fees or interest you didn't expect,None,"I, XXXX XXXX, am filing a formal complaint against Synchrony Bank for not properly and fully cancelling out a loan request account, after providing Synchrony Bank and Roto Rooter with my clear and concise decision not to proceed with either the repair to fix the sewer pipe and to stop and or cancel any loans or accounts from proceeding immediately. 

On XX/XX/2023, I requested that XXXX XXXX come out to my home to assess a leaky pipe connected to my home sewer. 

I was advised that my main sewer line needed a new interior lining from XXXX XXXX whose office operates out of XXXX New York. 

While being overly approached and intimidated by several XXXX XXXX  XXXX  ( XXXX  ), I was provided with an astronomical quote and given an application from XXXX XXXX XXXX of XXXX XXXX to see if I had the option to get a loan with no interest to pay off the cost of the work to fix the actual pipe if I proceeded. 

I was approved XX/XX/2023 same day at XXXX XXXX  for the Synchrony Bank loan of {$18000.00} the amount XXXX XXXX quoted for the repair coordinated by XXXX XXXX XXXX of XXXX XXXX. 

Shortly after same day, XXXX, I contacted XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and advised to him that I wanted to get further estimates and that I wanted to stop any proceedings having to do with the sewer pipe fix and to stop any loan /account set up activity with Synchrony Bank XXXX 

I clearly in written text messages, just XXXX hours from the time the loan application and repair were quoted, advised XXXX XXXX XXXX of XXXX XXXX that I would not be signing the repair contract he just prepared and sent over to me, nor would I be moving forward with the repair or loan. My next step was to contact Synchrony Bank myself to ensure that this account would be confirmed closed, null and void. I asked XXXX XXXX XXXX of XXXX XXXX for Synchrony Banks contact information, and was refused. I was advised to XXXX it. 

XX/XX/2023 at XXXX in the morning, as soon as Synchrony Bank XXXX, I called and spoke with representative XXXX XXXX XXXX to advise that this account needed to be cancelled asap and that I would not be proceeding with this repair or loan. XXXX XXXX XXXX from Synchrony Bank XXXX at that time closed the account which had a {$0.00} balance. 
I confirmed with XXXX I had never signed the repair contract with XXXX XXXX. 

XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX Synchrony Bank advised that the account and loan were cancelled, however, I would need to contact XXXX XXXX  to have them lift the hold for the {$18000.00} that was placed thereafter I had provided written notice to XXXX XXXX  that I would not be proceeding with the repair or loan. 

I was appalled that the hold was even on the account since I never signed any contracts for this pipe to be fixed with XXXX XXXX, not to mention it was XXXX hours after the XXXX XXXX tech XXXX XXXX XXXX left that I had written him via text confirming that I was not moving forward with the repair and or loan. 

XXXX XXXX XXXX of XXXX XXXX acknowledged my request, and confirmed back that this request was heard and that he would advise both XXXX XXXX  and Synchrony Bank of the same that I would not be moving forward, with his assurances these matters would be completely taken care of. 

I contacted XXXX XXXX administration offices in XXXX New York and was transferred to the manager XXXX, who would not even give me his last name. He was clearly acting and responding very defensively, and I could tell, his best interest was not me. 

I wanted to let him know directly that I would not be proceeding with fixing the sewer pipe with them and that I needed him to remove the hold on the Synchrony Bank account asap and that I had never signed contracts to fix the pipe. 

XXXX, manager from XXXX XXXX assured me that he would take care of it right away and would contact the bank to remove the hold and that he would call and email me confirmation same day. I never heard back from XXXX this day as promised. I attempted to contact him again but he was not picking up the phone. 

XX/XX/XXXX, still no contact from XXXX at XXXX. I again called Synchrony Bank and requested to be transferred to a manager. I was transferred to a said supervisor, XXXX ID XXXX. I asked that they ensure this account was closed and that I receive written formal confirmation the account was closed and I once again stated I would not be proceeding, nor were any contracts signed to fix the sewer pipe with XXXX XXXX. 

XXXX XXXX XXXX, of Synchrony Bank XXXX tried to assure me that the account was closed but that XXXX XXXX XXXX still essentially bill Synchrony Bank XXXX and post a charge to this closed account, even though no contract was signed and the loan and was deemed cancelled. 

Synchrony Bank said the only thing I could do at this point was to have these conversations noted in the closed account case note section and that I should advise XXXX XXXX  the same, to lift the hold from Synchrony Bank. Being that XXXX, manager at XXXX XXXX was not cooperative, this was not an open avenue to take. I was advised to wait and see what happens and if necessary we could fight any charges posted as fraudulent activity. 

I called XXXX a third time from XXXX XXXX, and was connected to him. I asked why the Synchrony Bank account still had a hold when he advised he would remove it and send me written confirmation via email. He said he would take care of this in XXXX minutes. 8 days later, still no word or confirmation from XXXX at XXXX XXXX in XXXX NY and it is extremely unhealthy for me to speak with XXXX any further. 

In summary, this account that was set up prematurely with Synchrony Bank needs to be formally and entirely closed with written confirmation of such to myself. I need confirmation that no charges can be posted to this Synchrony Bank account that was requested to be closed on XX/XX/XXXX to a XXXX XXXX  XXXX XXXX XXXX, the XXXX XXXX assisting representative that coordinated communication between Synchrony Bank and myself and my clear and concise request to Synchrony Bank directly cancelling any open accounts or loans. 

These events with Synchrony Bank, have caused me distress and mental and physical distraught and are continuing to do so. 

If this matter is not resolved immediately and if this account is not completely closed out with no possibility of any charges posting, I will be communicating with my legal council. 

I hope you can see the urgency and actions in such an important matter. These dealings have grown into a deceitful, master manipulation.

I would like to report that Citizens Bank intentionally did not take out the amounts I owed in XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX and as a result, my credit score has plummeted. 

I was put in contact with XXXX XXXX from the Office of the Chairman who admitted that there was wrongdoing on Citizens Bank 's part but will not correct the issue. 

It is extremely deceptive to email consumers to their update payment information, but not indicate that a payment will not be made immediately. XXXX took my feedback to improve future communication with customers on her end ; however, refuses to resolve the issue that has impacted me. 

There are other consumers who were in a similar situation who had this issue resolved. Citizens Bank is not a consumer-friendly bank, but rather a collection agency. The company asks customers to put a credit card on file as opposed to the account number of a bank account to take out automatic payments for a loan. 

This is a malicious way to conduct business. There are customers whose debit cards may expire, be compromised, etc. and they are unable to make a payment due to no fault of their own. Citizens Bank intentionally wants to destroy the health of consumers credit with their misleading practices. 

Furthermore, there is nothing in the terms and conditions that states that a payment will not be processed the day that a consumer updates their payment information.

07/07/23,"Payday loan, title loan, or personal loan",Title loan,Struggling to pay your loan,None,"Please note : the below is verifiable. 

My loan payment is late. I work for myself. I accepted a check from a client that I have accepted checks from before in the past. However, this time I cashed the check and it bounced, which caused several bills to be returned. I contacted TitleMax and explained the situation. 

Money got returned to TitleMax. 

Now it seems they are refusing to take payment online. When I tried to contact them, all of the customer service numbers say they are after hours, although there website states customer service is available until XXXX XXXX CST. 

There is no automated number to accept payments by phone. 

They accept payments by XXXX XXXX, but not online. The customer must pay cash at a place that does XXXX XXXX. 

I would believe the majority of TitleMax customer base would be people who are in desperate need of funds and have limited means. 

I had proof to show TitleMax that what happened was not my fault and I did not make a payment in an unlawful way. Sometimes, their customers stories are true. 

I was behind for three weeks trying to catch up the money from the bad check while making money to pay current bills, too. 

My complaint is I have no way to make a payment because it is after hours. Thete customer portal will not let me make a payment There is no call center to help when after hours. TitleMax is making it very hard and inconvenient for their customers to pay after hours. 

Which is giving TitleMax more money in fees or it could cause a customer to become late by limiting their means to make a payment after hours. 

In addition, TitleMax should not punish a person if the payment gets returned once. TitleMax was not the only bill that was returned and no other businesses have required cash payments. If a person is a repeat offender and constantly makes unlawful payments, that is a little understandable, but one time can be forgiven as a mistake. Most people, rich and poor, have made some form of bank error at one time or another. Or perhaps, a check they deposited got returned as NSF. 

TitleMax business practices are already feeding on people with limited means and desparate. They charge outrageous interest, they continually try to sell their customers on extending their loans or taking out additional funds. If something happens where a customer is unable to make a payment, unlike several other business, TitleMax refuses to help their customers. They have no flexibility in payments. And to top it off, TitleMax can make it hard to make payment by limiting their customer 's ability to make a payment. 

TitleMaxs business practices are built to keep their customers in debt for as long possible. Their business practices are designed to take advantage of the poor and disadvantage. 

TitleMax should not have the authority to deny payments. They should not have the ability to make it hard, inconvenient, and, in some cases impossible, for their customers to make payments. Such practices where a company 's design is to keep people who are disadvantage and desparate in dept should be restricted and strictlu monitored. 

TitleMax should not have the right to do this to people. It is not right and immoral to take advantage of the disadvantage to furthet line the pockets of TitleMax. 

In addition, TitleMax should not loan more money than the car is worth The first loan was XX/XX/2023, I made my XXXX payment. TitleMax kept on calling to tell me about additional money, which I took out end of XXXX. The bad check was written to me beginning of XXXX and deposited on same day. I paid bills. Two days later, the check was returned as NSF. 

LOOK at the original loan and what I owe to pay it off today, XX/XX/2023.

I told him to cancel the prescheduled payment set up by the store for today, XXXX for {$73.00}. He said ok. Not only did he not call me today, but they attempted to withdraw that amount from my bank today. I emailed the store asking for a supervisor to call me on XXXX and XXXX but no response.

BTW, I have had XXXXne credit card for at least 10 years, I have paid off 3 cars as agreed on time, owned two homes and paid as agreed, and there was only one card in which payments got messed up and it did affect my credit, but I have gotten that resolved. Other than that, all my cards are always paid on time, and have been.

If my credit score is so badly affected at a XXXX, can you explain to me, why I could purchase a home with that score, but not get a loan? 
And yes, my credit card balances were somewhat high. That was XXXXe point of consolidation. To group things together and put it into one loan that we would have paid more on monthly to save interest. 
Now since they mention that this hard pull on my credit is impacting my credit score even more now, and AFTER THEY SAID I WAS APPROVED IN THEIR EMAIL, THIS COMPANY IS HIGHLY SUSPECT AND THEY NOW HAVE MY PERSONAL INFORMATION, AND IT CONCERNS ME! 
XXXX people should not have to fight for simplicity in obtaining a loan, if offered, because another company can not find ways to assist them. It is discrimination as far as I am concerned, since my daughter is XXXX and I am XXXX. 
Go on XXXX, go on XXXX, go on XXXX. Seriously???? We don't have an XXXX device, so are they going to give us access to one to simply complete an application? 
This is crazy!!!! 
My daughter also asked more than once to talk to a manager or supervisor, when this began to be an ongoing issue. Since the company says they are out of XXXX, there is no direct phone number to reach anyone inside the XXXX. It is very apparent by the accents of placing and recieving calls, from this company, that they are an offshore entity, and since there seems to be no supervisor nor manager that would speak to us, and with the many voices in the background, this is some kind of call center, and probably not a credible entity for loans. 
It is interesting that my daughter has gotten online loans with online companies and never had anything like this EVER HAPPEN TO HER!

This debt with Cavalary Portfolio collections hasn't been verified as a legitimate account. The company has not be able to provide the original contract between myself and the lender. Nor have they been able to provide a written statment from the creditor, identifying the collection agency as the legal owner or collector of the account. I've asked multiple times of them to provide validation. The best they have been able to do is send a written statement in the mail along with an outdated bill from the original creditor.

This is a summary of what I wrote to the credit bureaus.

07/29/23,"Payday loan, title loan, or personal loan",Installment loan,Struggling to pay your loan,None,"The reason I am writing is because I have been a victim of fraud/embezzlement. On XX/XX/XXXX, I got approved for a business line of credit to invest in a company my friend of 30 years was working for and invested in also. I only asked for {$35000.00} because that was all I needed to invest in a company called XXXX XXXX XXXX My title I was given was XXXX because I had excellent credit and the ability to help the owner grow the company. XXXX XXXX who gave me all the documents needed to submit to Kabbage now called American Express XXXX for funding my investment. The bank used to operate XXXX XXXX XXXX was XXXX XXXX XXXX which was added to the Kabbage business line of credit. My personal checking account with XXXX was also attached to the dashboard. I have 4 credit card accounts with American Express which were also compromised when adding XXXX XXXX to the Kabbage account. This was the account the auto payments for the line of credit were set up for repayment of the line of credit which was owned by XXXX XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX, Kabbage increased the line of credit to {$90000.00} without my knowledge or consent which is almost 3 times the amount I applied for and needed. This increase is the reason I am writing this to explain how the fraud/theft occurred which put me in fianacial debt for a company I did not own. My home was impacted and damaged from hurricane Nicole and I made a claim to my homeowners insurance company on XX/XX/XXXX. I am giving this information to support my claim that I have been a victim of fraud and embezzlement. Once Kabbage increased the available line of credit on XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX XXXX, the owner of XXXX XXXX XXXX used his bank which is XXXX to transfer the funds, and this is when the fraud occurred. I was unaware of the theft dealing with my homeowner 's insurance which was unavoidable to contain the damage and save my home. When I became aware of the increase and theft on XX/XX/XXXX, I contacted Kabbage and filed a claim. I was given an ID Theft Affidavit packet from Kabbage to help me through the process I had to do in order to report the fraud. I had a lot of pressure on me because of the XXXX and timeline given to complete the packet. XXXX week I was trying to get all this done which I completed everything except for getting a copy of the police report. Kabbage only gave me 10 days to attach copies of all documentation required in the checklist. I was told by customer care representative XXXX that all documents needed to be turned in within the 10 days or my claim would be rejected. I called Kabbage to inform that I was waiting for the sheriff 's office to release the police report I made on XX/XX/XXXX. The 10-day period was restarted, and I still was having a hard time getting my copy of the police report. The investigation was turned over to a detective XXXX XXXX whom I spoke with on XX/XX/XXXX. He explained that he was waiting on subpoenas from XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, XXXX and American Express. I told him I only had 10 days to fill out and complete the ID Theft Affidavit and I had already got an extension. He called me back and told me I could get a copy of what was ready for the report to submit to Kabbage. I submitted all documentation requested from Kabbage on XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX which had to be notarized. The first payment of {$5600.00} was due XX/XX/XXXX, which was paid from XXXX  bank. This is the only payment made by XXXX XXXX XXXX. I was promised by my friend XXXX that he would make the payments since Kabbage rejected my claim without giving me a reason other than I secured the loan with my social security number. I was very upset with American Express when I was told by the company supervisor that I could not get a copy of all transcripts from the phone conversations. I asked for the transcripts to assist in getting a lawyer to handle the dispute I was having with American Express. My credit cards are suspended for use due to the loan I can not pay because I never owned or gained any profits from XXXX XXXX XXXX On XX/XX/XXXX, I received an email from American Express stating that as a result of a recent review Kabbage Funding is temporarily suspending access to my line of credit. The email also stated before we can resume your access, we need some additional information. The email read Here 's what we need from you : Organized Documents ( Articles of incorporation OR Certified of Incorporation ) color copy of my government issues ID, and a PDF of the most recent one month 's bank statement directly downloaded from my bank. It also read to submit required information by XX/XX/XXXX or they may suspend your line of credit and close my account. This is where the factors of the company American Express Kabbage now changed to American Express XXXX have tried to cover their mistake in raising the line of credit in 6 days from opening and/or established. I already provided these documents when I applied for the {$35000.00} line of credit. The only reason I am in this debt to American Express Kabbage is because of the increase I never asked for.

XXXX of the loans ( the XXXX same as cash '' was made with Mosaic. 

Because we receive so much SPAM, most of which ends up in the SPAM folder which my wife and I never see, we make sure to NEVER receive paperless statements on any loan we take out. When completing the loan documents for this loan, I did read ( and agreed by signing ) that I was agreeing to e-sign the loan documents electronically, and I also knew that I was agreeing to receive the "" Loan Disclosures '' electronically, however I carefully checked to make sure I was not agreeing to receive paperless STATEMENTS since I wanted all statements mailed to my house so it will be received by my wife who promptly pays all of our bills. 

Getting solar was my project which my wife was not involved in, however as I said, she is the one who pays all of our bills as soon as we receive the statement. With Mosaic, they never mailed us a single statement telling us where to send payments, nor did they ever mail us anything that stated when the XXXX no payment period was ending, which we were told would be 12 months from the date our solar project was completed. 

As I knew the end of the XXXX period was getting close to ending ( at least so I thought anyway because I was basing it on the date my solar installation was completed ), I asked my wife if she ever received anything telling us how and where to send our payment to pay off the Mosaic loan. She said no, so I called Mosaic. They said the XXXX period just ended, and we now not only owe the balance of {$52000.00}, we also now owe {$6800.00} in interest for the XXXX period because we did not pay it before the end of the XXXX period which they said was XXXX. 

As you will see on the loan document that I am uploading, it says the first payment, which is supposed to be due at the end of the XXXX no-payment period, is "" estimated '' to be XXXX.

03/09/23,"Payday loan, title loan, or personal loan",Personal line of credit,Charged fees or interest you didn't expect,None,"This complaint follows an earlier complaint filed with the CFPB on XX/XX/2023 ( XXXX ) relative to the same monies that Truist Bank assessed me. 
Since I have been unsuccessful in resolving this matter internally with Truist Bank, as well as, externally via outside sources, I am initiating this new complaint because it is clear that Truist Banks handling of this instant financial business transaction was intentional and potentially systemic. This financial transaction/practice resulted in Truist Bank being overtly, unwarrantedly and disproportionately compensated for a service that unfairly and deceitfully exploited me. I believe that such transactions, practices, and junk fees should be restricted and addressed through regulatory mandates. 

As such, I lodge this complaint ( among other reasons ) as an input statement to the CFPB in opposition to Truist Banks assessment of junk fees ( extra, unnecessary, unexpected, valueless, redundant, financially burdensome fees ). 

Specifically, Truist has charge me excessive monies/interest/junk fees by approximately XXXX XXXX dollars -- for one day of service with my equity line. Neither the excessive junk fees nor the bases for the excessive junk fees were disclosed prior to the assessment. Also, these excessive, unwarranted and totally unfair junk interest fees are not written in any document or online information that would have provided me ( the consumer ) the ability to evaluate the worth or value of the banks service prior to implementation. 

In reality this ordeal involves one day. Had the business transactions been deferred "" one day '', I would not have been assessed concurrent payments of {$1000.00} ( under one account ) and {$1500.00} ( under another account ) at the same time. 

If the transaction had been established the day of the billing cycle ( closing one account at the end of the month and then establishing the new account at the beginning of the very next month ), the financial charges would have been approximately {$0.00} to {$35.00} versus approximately {$1000.00} on one of the accounts.

Or the financial transaction could have been implemented much earlier in the month when I requested the change-over which would not have resulted in such excessive financial interest fees. 

Above all, Truist personnel should have and could have advised me of its doubling-of-interest-assessment ramification practices vis -- vis its facially neutral billing cycle -- which would have provided me with the option to decline. 

None of this occurred. 

It is clear, that the timing of the financial transactions here was intentionally imposed so that Truist could assess and receive the maximum amount of fees/charges it could, regardless of the fact that the timing of the financial transaction -- not only -- provided absolutely no value to me ; but deceitfully resulted in my being assessed unexpected, disproportionate, unwarranted and burdensome junk fees. 

For the most part consumers understand the instability of our economy and the resulting impact that inflation, unemployment, interest rates and the like have on everybody and every institution. But, it is entirely wrong for a financial institution to assess an approximate 300 % profit in junk fees for one-day of service on the consumer. Truist did this to me and its ABSOLUTELY WRONG!!! 

I have been unfairly and deceptively robbed. I am a senior citizen in a retirement community and I have been robbed of a lot of money that took me many, many man-hours to earn. 

I was entirely misled. Moreover, during the period when I sought to get an explanation of the bases/rationale for the junk interest assessments, Truist never provided a clear clarification. As such, I initiated an internal dispute over the apparent ( to me ) fraudulent, duplicative fees, to no avail. Truist, nevertheless, while I was pursuing its Errors, Inquiries, and Disputed Policy, initiated delinquent actions against me ( contrary to its own internal written policy that allows for such disputed without delinquent action ). 

I have filed actions with the several credit bureaus to look at this injustice, without any successful outcome. I have called and written letter-after-letter up and down the Truists corporate structure. Again, there has been no successful outcome. After four-months of hitting brick walls ( after a host of harassing calls and harassing letters ), at the point that the matter had progressed to the 2nd level of Collections, a Collections Manager returned one of my calls. That Collections Manager took the time to explain Truists billing cycle practices which gives credence to my claim of Truists fraudulent and excessive junk fees practice. 

Under protest, I then paid the unwarranted junk fees.

Whether were talking about my being charged double interest or my being charged separate interest fees under two separate accounts, I have been victimized by Truist Bank. 

It should be against the law for Truist Bank or any other bank or financial institution to arbitrarily process financial business transactions in a manner ( or at a time ) that overtly and unwarrantedly compensates the financial institutions while at the same time disproportionately and deceitfully financially burdens and exploits the consumer. 

Having been a customer of this bank for over 4 decades and having utterly no prior issues, I am absolutely appalled, beyond words, by Truists flagrant misuse of its Dispute Policy, its unfair junk fee business practices, and intentional exploitation of its customers.

I seek your assistance in addressing this matter and ensuring that my rights as a consumer are protected. 

On XX/XX/2023, I initiated the process to pay off my loan with ACIMA. The original principal balance of the loan was {$330.00}, and I expected the final payoff amount to be consistent with this principal balance. However, to my surprise, the payoff balance quoted by the company amounted to {$730.00}. 

Upon inquiry, I discovered that the inflated payoff amount included exorbitant Non-Sufficient Funds ( NSF ) fees that were added to the balance. These NSF fees were levied due to a failed attempt to debit my account for the payment. I contend that the inclusion of these NSF fees as part of the payoff balance violates the TILA and consumer protection laws as I never ever received a billing statement by mail to advise of such charges being added to the principle balance. 

Subsequently, I contacted ACIMA to request a refund of the {$340.00} in NSF fees, which were wrongfully included in the payoff balance. In response, the company stated that these fees could be treated as part of the payment and added to the payoff balance.

01/20/23,"Payday loan, title loan, or personal loan",Personal line of credit,Problem when making payments,None,"Klarna offers a Financial product called one time card that allows their users to make a virtual card of a approved financed amount. The one time card product can be used for in-store purchases via XXXX XXXX. After the user makes a purchase they will pay off their purchase in installments of 4 payments. 
For any amount that is not used on the card the payment plan will be adjusted to what was spent ; example : {$40.00} One time card is used for a {$30.00} purchase, then the users repayment plan will be adjusted to the {$30.00}. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I made a one time card within the Klarna app for {$270.00} a in-store purchase at XXXX. The amount that I spent on the one time card was {$160.00} On the same day of the XXXX purchase, I returned the purchase at the same location because the item was not what I wanted. The refund was sent to Klarna card ending in XXXX for the amount of {$160.00} I then went to XXXX to purchase the items that I was intending to buy originally. I made another one time card within the Klarna app for {$460.00} at the XXXX store to be used as my payment method. The transaction amounted to {$450.00}. The next day On XX/XX/XXXX, I returned to the XXXX location that I made the purchase at to do a partial return of some of the items I brought the previous day using the Klarna payment method. The amount refunded was {$340.00}. The refund was sent back to the original payment method which was the Klarna one time card ending in XXXX. 

Both on XXXX and XXXX I followed up with Klarna to provide the return receipts for the XXXX and the XXXX return to make sure that my payment plan for the one time card will be adjusted accurately. Each time that I reached out, a representative insured me that my payment plan will be automatically adjusted, but this did not happen. 

In the process of reporting a return to Klarna they temporarily pause your payments to wait for the refund or to look into your claim. After close to 3 weeks after I originally reported the return, a Klarna dispute resolution specialist reached out to me via email pertaining to the XXXX order and asked for the receipt. After providing this information again I received a dispute resolution email on XX/XX/XXXX that states my payment plan for this transaction will be resumed for the original amount. The email eluded that that I received the refund XXXX sent and it was not sent to Klarna so I am still liable for paying for the unadjusted payment plan. Although The receipt that I provided clearly shows Klarna as the payment method that refund was issued back to. 

Similarly, I received a email from a another Klarna dispute resolution specialist requesting proof of the XXXX return. After providing both the original purchase receipt and the return receipt I received email from Klarna on XX/XX/XXXX that states since Ive been compensated by XXXX that my payment plan for this transaction will resume unadjusted. However, I have not received a refund from XXXX because the refund was sent to Klarna. 

In the process of trying to work with Klarna they have asked me to contact XXXX and XXXX which I did and they have confirmed verbally that the refund was sent back to the original payment method.

03/07/23,"Payday loan, title loan, or personal loan",Personal line of credit,Problem when making payments,None,"To whom it may concern, This letter is to submit a formal complaint against XXXX XXXX 
I have been a member of XXXX XXXX since XXXX or XXXX, when I first opened a variable rate HELOC account with them. 
Over the course of time with this account, I have consistently paid on time every month and never missed a payment. 
In the month of XX/XX/XXXX, I discussed with the Lender at XXXX XXXX  about switching my variable rate HELOC into a fixed/structured payment since rates were beginning to increase. The Lender that originated my loan was transitioning for a move from XXXX XXXX to another band at the time and very difficult to get ahold of, but he did make the switch for my account to a structured repayment loan with a fixed interest rate of XX/XX/XXXX XXXX for 10 years on XXXX XXXX. I began making the new structured loan payments at the bank and each month asking the teller to please check for the full amount due for payment. Each time the teller would confirm the amount due. The tellers at my branch have confirmed this action. 

I had received what I believed to be spam calls from someone claiming to be with XXXX XXXX They wanted me to give them my personal information and when I asked them to confirm who they were they would not, but only insist they needed me to give them my personal information. This happened a few times and one of those times was on my way to my branch to make a payment. I walked into the lobby while still on the line and asked the tellers if the bank would ever call and request my personal information. They said they would not and told me to hang up the phone. I explained to them that I had been a victim of identity theft before and was very wary of this sort of thing. 

I then received a letter int he mail stating that I was behind im my payments with XXXX XXXX. I brougtht this into the branch thinking it was a mistake or fraud and the branch manager said she would look into this as I had never been late on a payment, nevertheless miss a payment. The bank manager then found that there was {$15.00} that did not get transferred over with the switch form the variable rate HELOC to the structured repayment loan. The Lender that handled my loan did not inform me that there was {$15.00} he neglected to transfer with the switch, nor was this found with any monthly requests for the payment amount due at each monthly visit to the branch. This amount was promptly paid when found, but was too late. The powers that be at XXXX XXXX  had decided to cancel my structured repayment loan and fixed rate and sent me to collections. This plummeted my credit score by XXXX XXXX Multiple attempts were made by my branch manager to rectify this situation but to no avail. They choose to believe that I wanted to avoid this {$15.00} payment and damage my credit and good standing with the bank, even though I had made every payment on time. Why, I ask you would I do this? 

The only remedy XXXX XXXX  will offer is to re-apply for another structured repayment loan. Even if I wanted to do this, rates are well above my original structured fixed rate of 5.85 % for a 10 year loan. This would create {$1000.00} 's of dollars extra that I would owe with the higher rates. All of this for {$15.00}? 
*My credit has been damaged and will reflect a late mortgage payment for 2 years. 
*My loan has been cancelled. 
*I can not borrow money on my credit line any longer, which is hindering plans I have for other investments. 
*I can not restructure without owing thousands of extra dollars due to a much higher rate. 

I believe this is deceptive and unfair practice on the part of XXXX XXXX I am disgusted and distraught that this bank is not willing to budge over {$15.00}, even with the requests for help from the Manager of the branch I patronize. 

I ask you, as a consumer, to help with this unfair and frankly ridiculous punishment XXXX XXXX  has taken against a customer with an unblemished payment history.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,ZIONS BANCORPORATION,CO,809XX,None,Consent provided,Web,03/07/23,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,6661287

05/12/23,"Payday loan, title loan, or personal loan",Installment loan,Charged fees or interest you didn't expect,None,"I am writing to file a complaint against Goodleap XXXX XXXX, headquarters located at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, CA XXXX. GoodLeap is a financial technology company that specializes in home improvement and solar loans. 

Related to 2 different home improvement loans funded by Goodleap, both loans/houses in Colorado, my complaint concerns the lack of sufficient and clear disclosure of money borrowed, balance owed, finance charges assessed on the monies borrowed, either on the monthly statement or on the online customer portal.

I am illustrating this lack of clarity with my firsthand accounts ending in # XXXX and # XXXX. Goodleap XXXX XXXX does not clearly break down and identify the amount of interest accrued, does not clearly break down and identify how the monthly payment is allocated, and does not clearly define the balance due, which makes it difficult for the consumer to understand the amount of interest charges being assessed, or to properly manage the outstanding loan. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I phoned in several times, asking to speak to different representatives, including managers of the Billing department. The calls are recorded and can referenced. The allocation of payment was explained such that I began accruing interest daily upon the loan being funded, several months ago. It was explained that my payments have first been applied to outstanding interest, with XXXX being applied to principal. This remains true with the first three payments until my payment exceeds the amount of outstanding accumulated interest. Only then will part of the payment be applied to principal. The financial debt is not easy to discern. On the statements it shows confusingly shows payments being made, but the balance due does not change ( neither go up or down ).

Another example of transparency. A paper check for {$3600.00} was snail mailed from XXXX XXXX XXXX to Goodleap because the loan amount was overfunded by Goodleap believing that would be financing more than expected, due to services that were originally considered but not installed by XXXX XXXX. Not having the 3 add-ons installed by the HVAC company reduced the total loan amount due. The HVAC company and I verified today XX/XX/XXXX, in a conference call with Goodleap, that the check was cashed by Goodleap. Check # XXXX cleared on XX/XX/XXXX, issued from XXXX XXXX XXXX to Goodleap. The online Goodleap portal does not reflect this finalized and cashed payment. The online statement does not reflect this payment. This {$3600.00} payment is obscurely reflected on a downloaded statement, but does not directly match up to clearly show a payment of {$3600.00}. The response from Goodleap is that only ACH payments are reflected within the payment history of the online portal. No other activity is reflected on the Customer Finance Portal.

This complaint is not about paying interest. This complaint is also not about the allocation of payment. The contract states : Payment Application. Your payments will be applied in this order : ( 1 ) accrued interest, ( 2 ) most recent unpaid principal to oldest, and ( 3 ) your fees or costs. I understand how minimum and exceeding minimum payments work, to increase or decrease interest owed. This complaint revolves around the unclear picture of the interest amount not being clearly identified and the unclear picture of how payment is allocated from Goodleap to consumer. This lack of transparency and clarity puts the consumer at a disadvantage and can potentially cause harm.

I have included statements per account that show payment amount, which show 100 % of the payment was applied to *interest only*, with no change in balance due ( which is confusing ), and does not identify how much interest was paid. In these examples, XXXX of the payment was applied to principal. I have also included a different creditor 's statement to illustrate the transparency and the resolution/information I expect to be made available by Goodleap. 

I have contacted Goodleap on this matter, and after much frustration and speaking to several representatives who have provided inaccurate information or inadequately explained how payments are allocated, I finally received a verbal response on XX/XX/XXXX, which was recorded by Goodleap. Goodleap indicated that if someone calls in, they can request information on how payments are applied, and the emailed response includes a detailed breakdown of payments applied to principal and interest, but the customer *must call in* to receive this information. The amount borrowed, due, interest charges, any adds/deduction from account, is information should be easily and readily accessible. 

As a customer of Goodleap XXXX XXXX, I have found it frustrating to navigate the company 's payment portal and statements, as the information provided is not transparent or clear. I believe that this lack of disclosure is a violation of consumer protection laws and is potentially harmful to consumers. 

I am filing this complaint with Consumer Financial Protection Bureau in hopes that this department can investigate this matter and take appropriate action. 

I would appreciate your prompt attention to this matter and your efforts to ensure that Goodleap XXXX XXXX provides clear and transparent information about finance charges, balance owed, monies borrowed, for its customers.

"" 1002.6-RULES Concerning Evaluation of Applications '' ( 6 ) Credit history. To the extent that a creditor considers credit history in evaluating the creditworthiness of similarly qualified applicants for a similar type and amount of credit, in evaluating an applicant 's creditworthiness a creditor shall consider : ( A ) The credit history, when available, of accounts designated as accounts that the applicant and the applicant 's spouse are permitted to use or for which both are contractually liable; * ( b ) On the applicant 's request, any information the applicant may present that tends to indicate the credit history being considered by the creditor does not accurately reflect the applicant 's creditworthiness ; and* ( C ) On the applicant 's request, the credit history, when available, of any account reported in the name of the applicant 's spouse or former spouse that the applicant can demonstrate accurately reflects the applicant 's creditworthiness. 

Paragraph 6 ( b ) ( 6 ) official interpretation 1. Types of credit references. A creditor may restrict the types of credit history and credit references that it will consider, provided that the restrictions are applied to all credit applicants without regard to sex, marital status, or any other prohibited basis. **On the applicant 's request, however, a creditor MUST consider credit information not reported through a credit bureau when the information relates to the same types of credit references and history that the creditor would consider if reported through a credit bureau XXXX ** The issue is that back in XXXX i requested wells fargo to consider additional information that was not reported through the credit bureau because my credit report was not an accurate representation of my creditworthiness. The information I provided was directly related to my reported credit history that Wells Fargo based its decision to deny my loan on, and is information that would be considered by Wells Fargo if it was on my credit report. Wells Fargo did not consider the information I provided because it is Wells fargos.policy to only consider information on an applicant 's credit report, nothing else. Wells Fargos policy does not comply with the rule cited above. When it comes to information not present on my credit report that is relevant to the decision, Wells Fargo must consider it at my request. 

Wells Fargo 's then made the unfair decision to deny my application with only the information on my credit repor when there was reason to believe was incorrect and/or incomplete and didnt truely represent my situation.. 

As stated by Wells fargo, here are the reasons my loan was denied in XXXX. 

XXXX application Legal or other action taken against you or your accounts ( For example, collection, tax lien, or charge off ] Serious delinquency and public record or collection filed Too many accounts with balances Proportion of loan balances to loan amounts is too high At that time, i tried to explain that I was a member of the sweet class and they were in the middle of settlements and my student loans were set to be forgiven in full. In XXXX My student loans made up around XXXX percent of my total debt. Without the student loans, i only had around XXXX total in debt in XXXX. 

I also tried to explain that any delinquency and the charge off on my credit report resulted from what happened between XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX. During those months I faced a series of events that most people would be financially affected by. High risk XXXX, break up, moving, job loss. Serious illness and then the death of my child. All of those things happening back to back and it is unlikely that will happen again. At that time, I didnt have enough credit history to get the loan I needed from my bank to prevent hardship or defaulting on my car loan. Had I got the loan I wouldn't have been as severely affected financially. Being turned down for such a small loan during the worst time of my life after entrusting us bank with my money for years is the reason I switched to Wells Fargo shortly after. 

This appears to be a cycle I will forever be stuck in. Wells Fargo will not approve me because of the damage caused by my inability to get the loan from XXXXXXXX XXXX  that I needed to get me through a tough time and prevent an impending financial catastrophe. The damage caused by Wells fargo 's denial will prevent me from getting a loan if I ever need one in the future I also had 2 accounts opened fraudulently in my name. One has been removed, the other was supposed to have been removed, but never was and is in collections. I recently called them to find out why it wasnt removed l and they now are saying I need a police report. It's been almost 6 years, I don't even know if I can't file one after so much time has passed. 

I had 10 open credit accounts on XXXX in XXXX. All XXXX of them had perfect payment history, XXXX of them had a XXXX balance. The balance on the other XXXX accounts was under XXXX collectively. I was working on building my credit, i had to open accounts to do that. How is the number of accounts that i had open relevent? What if I had XXXX account with a XXXX balance instead of the XXXX accounts with under XXXX? This is discriminatory. Wella Fargo knows that it has lent money to people that have more than XXXX accounts with balances that total more than XXXX. furthermore, all of my account balances were going to be paid off with the loan, which means that had Wells Fargo considered and approved the loan. The only debt I would currently have is the loan and I would have XXXX credit accounts with XXXX balance right now. 

There was no reason to deny my loan in XXXX. In reality. XXXX I had a credit score around XXXX. I had XXXX in total debt. Some negative information on 1 account 6 years ago from a personal crisis and I paid XXXX in full to settle that account when i was on my feet again. Since then I demonstrated nothing but exceptional payment history on XXXX accounts for the last 4 years. With that information, it is more than evident that the negative information on my credit history did not happen because I am irresponsible, but because I cant get approved for a loan every single time I need one. 

My subsequent applications are irrellevent. Wells Fargo didn't follow the rule above starting in XXXX. That failure ultimately resulted the financial crisis I am currently experiencing because I was unable to pursue opportunities i had available to earn an income little by little my life and all the progress I have made in the last 5 years has been destroyed. 

Wells fargo also stated it had confirmed both of my rate checks in XX/XX/XXXX which returned offers and the XXXX rate check that denied an offer. 

It failed to mention confirmation of the rate check in XX/XX/XXXX that did not return an offer. I would like an explanation in wells fargos response specifying reason I was given an offer in XXXX then denied an offer in XXXX when nothing had changed on my credit during the month and a half period in between those 2 dates. 

Wells fargo also did not include confirmation of the rate check I did XX/XX/XXXX. 

Wells fargo then stated my XXXX rate check expired on XX/XX/XXXX and they were unable to give it further consideration. True, but Being that the response was dated XX/XX/XXXX. My rate check from XX/XX/XXXX was not yet expired therefore further consideration still could have been given. 

Because the XX/XX/XXXX rate check is now expired, I am informing you that i will be performing another rate check upon submission of this complaint so you have an open application. However, being that it was Wells fargos policy that perpetuated the current damage on my credit report, I should be evaluated in accordance to my financial situation in XXXX since that is when wells fargo did not comply with the rules that govern it. It's the right thing to do. 

Wells fargo stated it gives all customers fair and consistent treatment. In reality, I'm not being denied for any of those reasons wells fargo listed. I'm being denied because of my position. Perfect example of that is that, after i offered to secure the loan with the title to my car in my last complaint, Wells Fargo 's added the fact that I don't have assets in a Wells Fargo account as a reason for denying my XXXX application. First, why was that not a reason listed in the XXXX denial. That fails to demonstrate consistency. 

Second, How is that requirement fair when it ultimately results in the exclusion of every economically disadvantaged applicant that banks with Wells Fargo. That results in disparate treatment if the only the customers who are fortunate enough to have assets in a Wells Fargo account are worthy of receiving a loan through Wells fargo? If that's the case, Wells Fargo should not include money deposited by customers with no assets into any calculation that benefits Wells Fargos bottom line, this way the relationship is mutually beneficial and customers aren't being used. 

Im sure that wells fargo is aware that 4 out of 5 credit reports contain errors. Even more, Only 2 percent of disputed errors get resolved. How Does wells fargo treat its customers fairly, if customers are given no consideration when they request Wells Fargo to consider information that is not on their credit report? 4 out 5 people who apply for a loan with your bank are not treated fairly because they can not explain away an error that they can't get corrected with the agency reporting it. How is it fair to anyone to be evaluated with a tool that contains errors XXXX percent of the time? 

Consistency often gets confused as being fair when it really is not the case in all situations. Consistency is only fair when it's applied to a group of people who are all the same. It is not fair when applied to different people that have different financial situations and that have traveled down different paths in life. Consistency, in that case, Will always result in exclusion of 1 or more groups within the whole. Consistency also doesnt result in fairness if credit reports are the only tool used to evaluate an applicant because credit reports are consistently flawed. If you want consistency to be fair you need to take a different approach to evaluating your applicants. One that considers each persons individual circumstances and doesn't rely solely on reports from sources that have a history of reporting inaccurate information because that leads to unfair treatment and unreliable decisions. 

None of the negative information came from irresponsibility or lack of concern about my finances and none of it would be there if i was able to access the money I needed when I needed it. My credit isnt perfect and it never will be if i have to be financially ruined every time a major event occurs in my life simply because of damaged caused by the previous denial. I will also never have assets if this is going to be the cycle I have to go through for the rest of my life. 

I ask that Wells fargo hold itself accountable for its failure to comply with the law and take into consideration the harm it caused me.

They don't have that ability within the app, so on XX/XX/23 I reached out to customer service to request my bank be changed. 

Customer service responded that in order to change my bank, they needed to know the name of the bank and screenshots of my transactions. I let them know the name of the bank, but did not send screenshots as this company has consistently shown they can not be trusted and I do not trust their representative to have screenshots of my bank account. I have several reports in the past I've submitted regarding their app issues that prevented users from being able to pay their balance. 

The rep tried to explain the rationale behind this, however, in the past they've been able to do this without the extra request. They then also suggested sending in a check, which would be great however this company has no direct phone support and no office I can visit, so I do not trust sending them a check. Grain had major app issues in the past, many consumer complaints and they have no done anything to re-earn trust for me to send a paper check through mail. They've also had other ways to process payments in the past and are pretending they took them away. 

I finally decided it's best that I close this account since I truly do not trust the company. However, they won't even let me pay the remaining balance. Grain is an aggressive, unprofessional company that takes advantage of its lacking app to force customers into pay late fees, reporting inaccuracies on credit reports, and not providing proper ways for customers to pay their balance. 

I want to close my account and be able to pay via a one-time link they've sent me in the past, or to update my bank account and send an electronic payment. Based on this company 's history, that is the only way I feel that my money is safe and protected paying them and they need to honor this request.",None,"Grain Technology, Inc.",CT,06360,None,Consent provided,Web,04/03/23,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,6789241

During a recent credit application process, Koalafi denied my request for credit. This, in itself, is not the issue. The problem lies in their failure to provide specific reasons for this denial. Such behavior is a direct violation of the FCRA, specifically 15 U.S.C. 1681m ( a ), a law designed to ensure transparency and fair play in credit dealings.

The FCRA clearly mandates that if a credit application is denied, or if the terms offered are less favorable than those typically provided, the creditor ( in this case, Koalafi ) must offer clear, comprehensible reasons for their decision. Unfortunately, I received a simple notice of denial with no explanation whatsoever. This leaves me, and potentially other consumers, without any understanding or guidance on how to improve our credit standing with them in the future.

In response, I requested Koalafi to : Provide me with specific reasons for the denial of my credit application, as per the FCRA.

Confirm that they've implemented necessary processes to comply with the FCRA and to prevent such issues in the future.

Remember, failure to adhere to FCRA regulations can result in serious penalties for companies, including statutory damages, punitive damages, and attorney 's fees, as per 15 U.S.C. 1681n and o.

I am sharing my experience to alert potential customers of Koalafi 's violation. I hope that my review can help others make an informed decision. I am currently awaiting their response and resolution of this matter within 15 days from my initial complaint.

If I don't receive a satisfactory resolution, I am prepared to pursue further legal remedies. In the meantime, I would advise anyone considering applying for credit with Koalafi to be wary of their non-compliance with the FCRA, a critical consumer protection law.

On XX/XX/XXXX - I reached out by phone to the branch about my loan balance and options for consideration of refinancing my loan based on financial hardship I am currently facing. In my research of my loan and review of statements - I noticed that a refund for a product ( involuntary unemployment insurance ) was issued to my current loan in the amount of {$650.00}. I told the supervisor - that I was unaware of this "" product '' being on my loan. And I asked for more information - including the total amount that I paid originally - including the interest. I was told that this information could not be retrieved - and that I should have paid more attention to what I signed up for. I also requested follow up to my question about the consideration of refinancing my current loan- and I was told that there is no option. I was also never told that my loan was incurring a {$5.00} per day interest fee - since its inception. So, even after never missing a payment for 1 year only {$1200.00} of {$4300.00} paid has been applied to my principal balance. I believe that there is predatory practices at play here- as I could not get a straight answer that was consistent between associates at One Main. As representative even told me that they had no record of me having a previous loan with their company- and it took a supervisor an extensive amount of time to locate my account to provide any specifics on my original loan information with the company. I have also become aware of a recent enforcement action from CFPB leveled against One Main Financial - and I asked the Supervisor I spoke with today if my account with One Main Financial had any relevance to the enforcement action, as I was never told I had previously opted in-to both a Life Insurance policy nor an involuntary unemployment product. I was told I could contact the insurance company as the records were "" too old '' to retrieve.

07/02/23,"Payday loan, title loan, or personal loan",Installment loan,Charged fees or interest you didn't expect,None,"Subject : Complaint Regarding Excessive Charges on Car Loan Credit Acceptance account : XXXX Dear Sir/Madam, I am writing to file a complaint regarding the exorbitant charges associated with my car loan credit acceptance, which has placed a significant financial burden on me and has negatively impacted both my credit report and personal life. I urge you to investigate this matter and take appropriate action to rectify the situation. 

I entered into an agreement with Credit Acceptence on a car loan ACCOUNT # XXXX for the purchase of a car XXXX XXXX XXXX The original price of the car, as stated in the sales agreement, was {$16000.00}. However, I have recently discovered that the terms and conditions of the loan have led to an exorbitant cost of credit, causing me substantial financial distress. 

The annual percentage rate ( APR ) applied to my car loan is an astonishing 22.99 %. and now the loan is {$41000.00} This excessive interest rate has led to a total cost of credit that far exceeds the initial price of the vehicle. I find it unconscionable that I am being charged nearly three times the original cost of the car due to the exorbitant interest rate now the prices went up to. As a result, I am struggling to meet the monthly payments, which has led to late payment penalties and a decline in my credit score. 

The financial strain caused by this loan agreement has had a detrimental impact on my personal life as well. The stress of constantly falling behind on payments, fearing repossession, and experiencing a decline in my creditworthiness has taken a toll on my mental and emotional well-being. It has caused sleepless nights, XXXX, and a sense of hopelessness. 

I am seeking your assistance in rectifying this unjust situation. I kindly request that you investigate the terms and conditions of my car loan agreement and take appropriate action against Credit Acceptence for their predatory lending practices. I believe that such practices not only exploit vulnerable consumers but also undermine the principles of fair lending and consumer protection. 

I kindly request the following actions be taken : 1. A thorough investigation into the terms and conditions of my car loan agreement with Credit Acceptence focusing on the excessive interest rate and the resulting exorbitant cost of credit. 

2. An assessment of the appropriateness and legality of the terms and conditions imposed by Credit Acceptence, particularly in relation to the applicable consumer protection laws and regulations. 

3. Prompt intervention and enforcement action against Credit Acceptence, if found to have engaged in predatory lending practices, to ensure fair treatment and appropriate remedies for affected consumers. 

4. Assistance in renegotiating the terms of my car loan to a more reasonable and manageable interest rate that reflects market standards and promotes affordable monthly payments. 

I am hopeful that, with your intervention, a resolution can be reached that alleviates the financial burden imposed on me and prevents further harm to my credit report and personal well-being. I kindly request that you keep me informed of any progress made in addressing this complaint and the steps taken to rectify the situation. 

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to a favorable resolution and appreciate your efforts in upholding consumer rights and ensuring fair lending practices.

07/15/23,"Payday loan, title loan, or personal loan",Installment loan,Charged fees or interest you didn't expect,None,"To Whom It May Concern I am respectfully presenting to your offices for evaluation a pattern of fluctuating interest amounts charged by Santander month to month. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I contacted and spoke to XXXX XXXX, of Santander Banks Executive Offices. 

I informed XXXX XXXX that before calling her that I ran an amortization schedule ( See attachment 1 ), from the inception of the loan XX/XX/XXXX, including a change to accommodate the additional principle amount of {$49.00}, XX/XX/XXXX, which I requested, for a total monthly payment of {$400.00}. 

Contractually, each month, I am required to pay a total of {$350.00} which I agree with consisting XXXX interest and principle. ( See attachment 2 ) Of the monthly contractual {$350.00} ( interest/principle ), I asked XXXX XXXX why XXXX monthly statements contain small inconsistencies in which the interest and principle amounts fluctuate, whereby sometimes more interest is charged, followed by less interest charged the next month. ( See attachment 1 ) I pointed out that the amortization schedule which I ran, as referenced above attachment 1, indicates that less principle is owed than Santander acknowledges. I asked XXXX XXXX to please provide me with an amortization from the Bank. for my comparison. 

I reviewed the following data from several monthly statements with XXXX XXXX, excluding XX/XX/XXXX, which was not yet received by me reflecting the inconsistency in interest charges. Immediately afterward I sent her the data as an XXXX spreadsheet  ( See attachment XXXX ). 

XXXX of the {$350.00} the interest was reduced from the month before to {$57.00}. 
XXXX of the {$350.00} the interest was increased from the month before to {$60.00}. 
XXXX of the {$350.00} the interest was reduced from the month before to {$59.00}, then XXXX of the {$350.00} the interest amount increased from the month before to {$62.00}, XXXX of the {$350.00} the interest amount was reduced from the month before to {$57.00}, XXXX of the {$350.00} the interest amount was increased from the month before to {$64.00} I also discussed with XXXX XXXX that I have reviewed the loan contract and could see no reason to explain the fluctuation of interest that occurs month after month in small amounts. Since the first payment, my monthly payments are tendered automatically, paid on time. 

Effective XX/XX/XXXX, Santander has notified customers that it is no longer mailing statements to customers, my concern is that it does not alter its content because when one goes online the statement shown is an overview, which does not contain the monthly interest and principle components of the monthly amount due as it does on the mailed statement. ( See attachment XXXX which can be compared to attachment XXXX XX/XX/XXXX statement ) While this is a concern, the primary concern is the inconsistent interest amounts charged without clear explanation. 

Since my conversation with XXXX XXXX XX/XX/XXXX, is like others in the past, Santander has been unresponsive. My subsequent calls to XXXX XXXX have not been answered nor have I received her response to my query or the amortization schedule as she promised, whether by telephone, email or mail. 

I appreciate resolution not just for myself as a non-collateral loan recipient but for others that may also be experiencing this without realizing or if they realize without response insofar as Santander is an unresponsive organization until an agency reaches out to it.

I have used Flex for the last couple of years since XXXX XXXX ( and when it was XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ) started offering Flex. I have had no problems with the Flex system until it came time for my rent to be paid for XXXX. 

In late XX/XX/2023, I renewed my lease for an additional 11 months. With this renewal also came a significant rent increase of {$170.00} per month. When this new lease kicked in, the Flex system had an immediate issue with my rent. I unlinked and relinked my account in time but Flex did not cover my rent. I ultimately paid my rent in full via my propertys rent portal on XX/XX/XXXX and placed my Flex membership on immediate pause. I contacted Flex Support at the time but they blamed technical difficulties in my rent not getting covered by Flex. I paid my rent as per my lease, I had to have rent paid on the XXXX to avoid late fees. 

I unpaused my membership in Flex after XX/XX/XXXX to cover my rent for the month of XX/XX/2023. On XX/XX/XXXX, I contacted Flex Support as a precaution in order to make sure my rent for XX/XX/2023 would be covered by Flex. Flex support assured me in writing that it absolutely was covered. However, I began receiving mixed communications from XXXX at Flex Support, including XXXX such communication that indicated that my total rent bill was {$1800.00}, which was not correct as I had verified my amount on my rent portal. I asked for verification that the property was linked correctly and XXXX reported that it was linked correctly. However, the response did not come until Saturday XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX. I remained in contact with support via email during the rest of the day and they assured me it would be processed Within a couple of hours. However, by XXXX XXXX my rent still had not been processed by Flex. I ended up paying my rent manually in full via the property rent portal. I also advised Flex support in email and requested a contact with a manager from Flex. As of XX/XX/XXXX, that has not occurred. I have also included payment_team @ getflex.com and team @ getflex.com. Payment Team replied back to email support. The fact that email seems to be the only way to reach support is very, very, very frustrating to say the least. With a company that covers rent like Flex, you honestly think that telephone support with a real, live human being would be an option, but it is not in this case. Flex 's management response was to waive my membership fee and yet again they said it was "" Technical difficulties '' without detailed explanation and assured me in early XXXX that it would not happen again. 

The issue, however, has reoccurred again for XX/XX/2023 rent. I contacted Flex on XX/XX/XXXX and they assured me my rent would be covered. However, on XX/XX/XXXX, rent was not paid again. Repeated emails to Flex support on XX/XX/XXXX were ignored and received no response whatsoever from Flex. Calls to their support line ( XXXX ) just went to voicemail. 

The level of support I have received from Flex has been insulting and angering to say the least.

I also discovered that the passwords of my frequently used personal mailbox and its recovery email had been changed. This made me realize that there was a significant problem, and I immediately contacted XXXX XXXX from another phone to report the issue. Unfortunately, they were unable to take immediate action, and it took them three business days to send me a new XXXX card. I received the new XXXX card on XX/XX/XXXX and reactivated my mobile number. 
However, on XX/XX/XXXX, my personal email setting ( including all services related to my XXXX account ) was changed again. The recovery mobile phone number was changed from my number to XXXX, a number I do not recognize. As a result, I was unable to retrieve my password and access my XXXX account. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a notification on my XXXX mobile app that someone had changed my password. I quickly logged in using FACE ID and changed the password again, but it was changed again by someone after a while. So, I immediately rushed to the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX located at XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, CA XXXX, and spoke to a banker. I explained that my mobile phone had been ported out, and I could not access my email that associated with my XXXX online banking. I requested that my account be locked. The banker assisted me by modifying the mobile phone number to my wifes number and changed the associated email in my account but informed me that they could not lock the account since no abnormal behavior had been detected so far. However, they offered to lock my online banking so that no one could log in without visiting the bank before unlocking it. Since XX/XX/XXXX, I have been unable to log in to my online banking and haven't received any information regarding accounts activities. On XX/XX/XXXX, after retrieving my mobile phone number, I visited the bank again to unlock my online banking. Upon logging in, I discovered that from XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX, a total of 6 transactions had been made, transferring a total of {$5900.00} from my checking and savings accounts to XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, and XXXX XXXX bank accounts, which were opened in my name. I had not opened accounts in these banks, but my identity information was used by criminals to open them. I contacted these banks and suspended these accounts. I then contacted XXXX at the XXXXXXXX XXXX and applied to reverse these transactions. 
Since I retrieved my mobile phone number, I have been able to receive text messages. However, I discovered that in addition to those banks mentioned above, the criminals also used my personal information to apply for credit cards and personal loans in financial institutions such as XXXX, XXXX, and Affirm. Some applications were blocked after I contacted them, while others were approved and already been used by the criminals. Moreover, I realized that my personal XXXX XXXX XXXX had been stolen and used by the criminals at XXXX in FL. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a call from XXXX XXXX XXXX informing me that all my cash back, amounting to more than {$800.00}, had been redeemed to a XXXX account on XX/XX/XXXX. The bank blocked this transaction after confirming that it had occurred without my knowledge. Consequently, I requested a new credit card to be mailed to me. 

Until today, all accounts that were not opened by me have been closed or resolved, with the exception of the loan account from Affirm Inc . I have been in contact with them for nearly two months, but they have been unable to resolve the issue and continue to state that it is under investigation. I have also raised a dispute with XXXX to have this matter removed from my credit report. However, when XXXX reached out to Affirm, they confirmed that the information provided was accurate and that their processing of my dispute did not result in any changes. I kindly request that Affirm expedite the investigation and resolve my issue more promptly.",None,"Affirm Holdings, Inc",CA,94539,None,Consent provided,Web,07/02/23,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,7184523

04/20/23,"Payday loan, title loan, or personal loan",Personal line of credit,Struggling to pay your loan,None,"I have made multiple attempts in the course of many years now to try and find a solution with the bank on my personal loan. The minimum payment is too high. And the bank time and time again refuses to discuss options or programs they have available. Emails to their CEO including upper level management personal have gone unanswered and to my assumption probably deleted unread. The bank is well aware of my difficulty with repayment. And instead of helping me as any other bank has they have instead killed my credit to the point I'm considering bankruptcy and other services to discharge this bill and end ties with the bank. 

I have mentioned that I can and will only be paying a lower amount month on my loan. This is probably going to cause them to keep sending late payments to my credit and piling up fees on me. But at this point they can can do whatever they need to as they can't hurt my credit any more than it is. And if I mentioned that the lower amount is all I can pay, using force to get more will result in no additional payments as I'm literally giving everything I have in my possession to make a payment. I'm not refusing to pay. I'm making the payment I am simply not making the agreed upon payment because I can't do it anymore due to financial hardship. 

Today, I've attempted again to get help. The bank asked me to fill out a refinance application which they knew their system would decline. Basically making a mockery of the situation and bullying me. This is a new level of unprofessionalism I've ever seen. And board-line harassment. I have every single email sent including all my attempts to work with the bank documented. I've made every attempt to pay back what I am responsible for as that's the focus of this compliant. I want to pay it. I just need help. The bank probably made back at this point the entire value of the loan in interest payments that they have been charging me. So the bank isn't at any lost to work with me. It would be a win for them as they make even more money out of me while in the process making sure to make my life XXXX for many years to come. They win, and I lose big. 

Again, my complaints and escalations are all in attempts to secure a new agreement with the bank to be able to reduce my minimum so I can satisfy the enter amount. If the bank works with me and is able to reduce the amount then this compliant is satisfied. If the bank continues to play hardball I will continue to move forward with escalations and complaints until we can agree on something that works for everyone. 

I'm not running away from trying make payments I'm just trying to instead make the payment without further harassment from the bank.

XXXX refuses to send me a refund and Affirm will not send a refund based off me receiving the replacement watch that was returned.

I have provided all documents proving I am in the right for my refund for what I have paid on the watch. XXXX jewelry is non responsive to any communication from me which makes it even more serious that I am being scammed out of thousands of dollars.

I would appreciate it if you could forward this complaint to the appropriate department for investigation and resolution. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I took out an initial loan from TitleMax. At that time, I specifically requested a change in the due date to the XXXX of each month, as agreed upon with an in-store representative. However, despite this agreement, TitleMax failed to make the necessary adjustment, resulting in overpriced interest charges on the loan. 

In an attempt to rectify the situation, on an unspecified date, I made a larger payment of {$800.00} towards the loan. I explicitly requested that the remainder of the payment be applied to the principal balance. Regrettably, TitleMax disregarded my request and instead applied the payment as an additional interest payment, further exacerbating the financial burden imposed upon me. 

Recognizing the need for a change in the payment date, I contacted TitleMax on XX/XX/XXXX, requesting that the due date be shifted from the XXXX of each month to the XXXX. To my surprise, I was informed by a female representative at the store that I would need to refinance the loan to make this change. She directed me to go online to initiate the refinancing process. In compliance with her instructions, I made an additional payment of {$600.00} to complete the loan refinancing, expecting to achieve the desired due date change. Unfortunately, the result of this transaction was a due date set once again for the XXXX of each month. 

In an attempt to gain clarity and obtain copies of both the previous and new loan documents, I visited the TitleMax store on XX/XX/XXXX. To my dismay, the same female representative who had previously instructed me to refinance the loan denied my request for loan documents, preventing me from fully understanding the terms and conditions of my loans. 

These events have left me significantly disadvantaged, both financially and in terms of my rights as a borrower. I firmly believe that TitleMax 's actions constitute violations of the ECOA and unfair loan practices, as they have consistently failed to honor agreed-upon due date changes, misapplied payments to the detriment of principal reduction, and denied access to loan documents.",None,TMX Finance LLC,AZ,85353,None,Consent provided,Web,06/25/23,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,7164801

Companies and bureaus have a duty to keep customer information accurate and up-to-date, and the FCRA mandates that credit bureaus make every effort to ensure that information in consumer reports is as accurate as possible. Thus far, Wells Fargo and the relevant authorities ' responses have fallen shortof these requirements. 

I have not been given any information about the ( representative ) you contacted, including their names, email addresses, or phone numbers. 
You haven't offered any proof that the late payment you mentioned actually occurred. 
The incorrect late payment remains on my account even after XXXX  days have passed. 
The Bureau 's nor Wells Fargohave n't kept my file correct, current, and complete. 
Both Wells Fargo and the Creditcompanieshaveslandered me. 

That Wells Fargo decietfullyconverted my personal loan account ( # XXXX ) into a car loan without my written consent and is currently reporting I was late on my XXXX paymentthat I have never been 30, 60, or 80 days late on a payment is the purpose of this complaint.Theattachments attached hereto. First, I've attached Wells Fargo 's cashier 's check and the transaction receipt showing the teller placed the moneyinto my XXXX  account. The banker XXXX told meXXXX XXXX XXXX, whose XXXX card is on the receipt, would transfer the monies into abusiness account she would open for me. She wasn't present when I signed the loan forms in Wells Fargo XXXX 

The secondbundle of papers includes XXXX Loan Agreement. This loan wasprocessedXX/XX/XXXX. The loan officer said my monthly payment would bedue on the XXXXXXXX of each month. How the third of the month hadbecome the new normal, I have no idea. But I left Wells Fargo for XXXX XXXX XXXX and transferred all my accounts there. Wells Fargo turned my Personal Loan into an Auto Loan and Imoved my monthly payment due dateto the XXXX instead of the XXXX  of each month. New account number : XXXX was record as a XXXX  loan. I decided to transferbanks since Wells Fargo did not keep its word by opening my XXXX account as agreedand by changing various terms of the Personal Contract Agreement. 

Mypayments wereautomatically debited from my account every month per the Personal Loan contract, so I never waslate. However, Wells Fargo quickly charged me late penalties and extra interest due to the way they begancoding of my payments in their bank'ssystems. Payments were late after the XXXX  day of each month instead of the XXXX day of the month agreement, nor was the grace period given untilthe XXXX day of the month when a late fee should access. The revised due date is crucial for my account payments because my payment is never 30 days late, even if it arrivesthe XXXX of the following month. When I made thepayment on XX/XX/XXXX, it was not 30, 60, or 80 days late. XX/XX/XXXX wasnot the pay date. There was no need to hold the payment no late fees or interest were due. And I shouldn't have had to pay anyinterest and late penalties, either. Wells Fargo 's system unintentionally overdrew my XXXX  account for two months on XXXXinstead of one payment ; thereforetherefore, they reversed the extra money as a missed payment. The pay history shows how the computer began accessinglate fees and interest from that point until the close of my account. Wells Fargo let the feescontinue to acureinstead of correcting it promptly. My paymenthistory shows I've never been late with a monthly payment. 

Thus, at the same time, I was having trouble with Wells Fargo correcting and apply my monthly payments to my accountcorrectlyXX/XX/XXXX & XXXX alerted me that an unknown vendor was making monthly unauthorized withdrawals from my account. After the Bankresearchedthe vendor, they informed me that Wells Fargo had made the withdrawals. Wells Fargo claims that a retailer who does business with their bank anelectronic signature authorized those withdrawals. evident shows the merchant made many withdrawals under different aliases to mask their genuine identity. I suspect the story of an electronic signature to be false. As a result, I was unable to get all of my stolen money back. I've attached the transactionsdocumentation. XXXX XXXX XXXX and Wells Fargo mishandled my personal and business accounts for a long time. Suddenly one day XXXX & XXXX without any prior warningquickly closed allmy accounts. Gave me the account numbers and suggestedI file fraud report withthe police. 

Despite never being late, Wells Fargo claims I have a late payment history. In response, they purposely reported my payments as 30-80 days late to the credit reporting firms whose reports are in the papers I've submitted. Finally, Wells Fargo admitted to deceiving me, overcharging me in interest, and reversing the late fees in four separateletters, and made a promise over the telephone my late payment would be corrected when I called in response to the check they said I never cash as a refund of the overcharged interest.

07/14/23,"Payday loan, title loan, or personal loan",Installment loan,Problem with the payoff process at the end of the loan,None,"On XX/XX/XXXX, I entered into a contract to renovate my master bathroom. The merchant offered me a 0 % interest loan if paid in full in 6 months through their embedded financing. Momnt technologies at XXXX XXXX XXXX # XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX is the loan servicing company and XXXX XXXX at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX is the lender of credit. After I signed the contract 100 % of the funds were released to the merchant ( aka they were paid in full vs drawing on the loan as work was completed ). The way this was presented was extremely deceptive. Once the funds were released, the level of communication with the merchant dropped off significantly. My initial walk through didnt occur until XX/XX/XXXX and the demolition of my bathroom didnt occur until XX/XX/XXXX and only after I made several calls to the merchant to begin work. After the demolition, the crew disappeared and I made no less than 13 calls to the vendor between XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX to get commitment to come back to the job site, mostly with no response or no commitment to do any work. This is documented in the scheduled issues tab of my attached question tracker xls. On XX/XX/XXXX I called Momnt, the loan servicer, and opened a ticket XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX, the merchant sent a plumber to complete the plumbing work which was extra cost to me ( that I paid directly to the subcontractor ) and explicitly excluded from the contract. On XX/XX/XXXX, Momnt closed my ticket with no resolution and with claims that they had tried to contact me ( which I had no missed calls or emails on record ) and despite the fact that XXXX of the contracted build back work had been started. On XX/XX/XXXX I sent an email again requesting that the ticket be reopened and reminding them of my initial request to either extent the loan or put the loan on hold and suspend interest accrual until the merchant actually made any kind of commitment to deliver. This correspondence is in attached email XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX, I opened a second ticket with Momnt XXXX detailing the continued lack of response or commitment from the merchant to complete the work. This communication is attached in XXXX. Momnt had indicated as part of their agreement with the merchant that the Merchant is supposed to maintain contact with the customer and that Momnt is there to work with me to ensure this is happening. However neither party is holding up their end of the deal and I am now faced with paying off a loan for services that have not been delivered and losing any kind of leverage I may have or accruing interest and making payments on the loan. On XXXX, the merchant did send XXXX person to begin tile work. After 2.5 days that individual disappeared and has not returned as of yet. They have also not returned multiple requests for scheduling any further work or delivering the materials I have paid for. The full communication with the merchant is detailed in my question tracker spreadsheet in the questions tab and the punchlist tab details the work done to date vs yet to be completed. Additionally, Momnt has provided 0 customer support in terms of resolving this issue. They do not respond to emails to their support email and their phone support is difficult to get a hold of. It seems that their representatives are always busy and when you select the option to receive a call back, they never cal you back. Also, you cant wait on hold as after a while they force you to select the call back option. You have to keep trying and hope to get lucky to get a person on the phone.

Unfortunately, everytime I would call nothing was offered to help me get back on track to making my account current again.

On XX/XX/XXXX the account was transferred to a different company called SST, Or Systems and services technologies inc. at this time I was advised that no changes will be made to my original contract and that SST would be handling my account further. I was also advised that the savings account that was originally set up by XXXX XXXX XXXX in part with the XXXX account, would be safe and secure and released to me 14 days after the final pay off was made. On XX/XX/XXXX, I made the final payment of XXXX $ to SST. This left my savings account balance at XXXX $ that would be sent to my checking account 14 days after pay off was made.

01/06/23,"Payday loan, title loan, or personal loan",Installment loan,Problem with the payoff process at the end of the loan,None,"This pertains to XXXXXXXX XXXX  XXXX, their XXXX XXXX XXXX, and XXXX  ( "" the company '' ). Essentially, the company did not notify or communicate regarding my card being declined, and therefore not used for auto-pay, on the date that auto-pay was set to occur. They claim communications happened on their end. However, I did not receive any communications as described below. Moreover, after the card was declined, they then processed a payment for a lower amount. This, in turn, meant I did not pay off the loan in time for a promotional period that would have meant I did not have to pay interest, resulting in my having to pay all of that interest. I would like to resolve this matter by being made whole for the interest paid. Details are described below. 

I have made $ 150 monthly payments from XXXX 2022 to XX/XX/ 2022, with the goal of then providing the final payment in XXXX for the loan. This was in alignment with the original promotional that I was taking action pursuant to. Under the promotion, there was no interest until 12 months after the contract was signed, and when the promotional ended all of the accrued interest is due at 24.99 % APR if the loan had not been paid in full. As is evinced by my payment record, I was on track to complete the payment fo the loan within the promotional period and thereby pay off the loan with no interest. 

Originally, the final payment was scheduled for auto-pay, as usual, on XX/XX/XXXX. This would have been in the amount of {$290.00} to make the final payment within the promotional period of 12 months, ending on XX/XX/XXXX. The card was declined and I was not notified. However, the company then subsequently processed a payment on XX/XX/XXXX, but for a lower amount of {$96.00}. They did not notify me that the card was declined, or that this payment was made in the lower amount. The critical aspect is that this was insufficient to meet the amount I had originally set for the auto-pay payment, thereby making me fail to pay off the right amount of {$290.00}. This meant that I had, then, failed to pay off the amount within the promotional period, incurring the payment of the full interest accrued thus far for {$260.00}. Given that I had been making all payments using their auto-pay system, there was no reason I should suspect any issue for the final payment, and expected notification if it did not proceed as normal. 

The company had never before failed to notify of auto-pay or other matters. However, their communications went dark in XXXX, right at the moment when they should have notified me of the last auto-pay reminder, the card decline, or my monthly e-statement. The final auto-pay reminder I received was on XX/XX/XXXX. The last communication I received was on XX/XX/XXXX. I have not cleared my junk folder since XXXX, so there is no evidence that it went to the wrong folder and was deleted. 

Hence, there are two main failures of the company. First, they had notified me of all events prior to XXXX, but right at the moment when the final payment truly mattered, they did not communicate any problems. I relied on their prior notifications and communications that payments were successfully being made. Second, whether with intent or not, the card was declined and then, critically, it was subsequently still billed, albeit for the lower amount, whereby the interest would kick in. Put differently, the auto-pay amount I had scheduled was not upheld as I thought it would be for the correct amount. None of this, again, was communicated to me. Importantly, even if the card was originally declined, it still should have processed the amount I set up when it did ultimately process a payment for a lower amount ( disqualifying me from the promotion ). In essence, I relied on their timely communications as well as their auto-pay system and, negligently, the company failed to notify or utilize the auto-pay amount that I had properly set up. But for this failure by the company, I would have paid off the loan and avoided the interest. 

I do not know if this was intentional or malicious, but it was, at least, negligent. It was a breach of their duties. I would like to seek a refund of the interest balance of {$260.00}, which I have paid.",Company believes complaint is the result of an isolated error,"Universal Account Servicing, LLC",CA,90018,None,Consent provided,Web,01/26/23,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,6407015

06/29/23,"Payday loan, title loan, or personal loan",Personal line of credit,Problem when making payments,None,"On XX/XX/XXXX, I mailed a payment to Grain Technologies in the form of a USPS money order ( Serial # XXXX ), because one of their payments ( in XX/XX/XXXX ) was returned undeliverable. I sent the payment via USPS Priority Mail with Tracking # XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. The payment was delivered by USPS to the address on the Grain Technology billing statement on XX/XX/XXXX, at XXXX XXXX  and left with the front desk, reception area or mail room. The documentation is attached. 

However, once the payment wasn't posted to my account, I reached out to Grain Technologies and was told by XXXX XXXX, that "" It can take up to 4 weeks before payment is applied to your account. '' This is in direct contradiction of their policy as shown on their billing statements and attached to this complaint. I replied that this payment was sent on XX/XX/XXXX, and that the amount of the payment was {$85.00}. I never received a response. 

This is problematic because the first payment mailed to that address was returned undeliverable. That returned payment caused Grain to enter a late payment on my account, which would have otherwise been on-time. This caused my credit score to dip because of their unprofessionalism by not sending me a payment link when requested. There's absolutely no reason that a company shouldn't send a customer a link to make an online payment, especially if they are contacted ahead of time with concerns about the payment being late. 

This payment appears to be lost and isn't reflected on my account, although it's been more than 5 business days.

07/18/23,"Payday loan, title loan, or personal loan",Installment loan,Getting the loan,None,"I am writing to file a complaint against Carvana , LLC, outlining their unfair business practices, deceptive conduct, and contractual violations. The details of my complaint are as follows : On XX/XX/XXXX, I engaged in a transaction with Carvana, LLC to purchase a XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, VIN : XXXX. However, shortly after taking possession of the vehicle, I encountered a major mechanical issue with the transmission, rendering the XXXX unusable. I promptly contacted Carvana, LLC to address this problem and seek a resolution. 

Instead of fulfilling their obligations under the purchase agreement, Carvana, LLC directed me to XXXX XXXX, their designated warranty administrator, effectively shifting the responsibility onto a third party. I complied and took the XXXX to an authorized service center on [ Date ], where it was confirmed that the transmission required a complete replacement, underscoring a significant mechanical defect. 

Throughout this process, Carvana, LLC exhibited a pattern of deceptive conduct and unfair practices. They consistently altered their stance and terms, hindering the resolution of the issue. Initially, they indicated that fees for mileage overage would be waived, only to later demand an exorbitant sum of {$2000.00}, effectively modifying the terms of our agreement without any justifiable basis. 

Furthermore, when I attempted to initiate a vehicle swap, replacing the defective XXXX with a XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, VIN : XXXX, Carvana, LLC introduced new conditions and requirements that had not been previously communicated. They requested bank statements, two years of tax returns, and additional financial information, which had never been requested in any of my previous dealings with them. This sudden change in requirements effectively prevented the completion of the transaction and acquisition of the replacement vehicle. 

Carvana, LLC 's conduct is not only unjust but also constitutes a violation of contractual obligations. They engaged in deceptive practices by consistently modifying the terms of our agreement to their advantage while disregarding the agreed-upon conditions. This conduct places an undue burden on consumers and undermines the trust that should be placed in Carvana, LLC as a reputable and responsible business entity.

I am seeking your intervention and assistance in addressing this matter. I request that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau conduct a thorough investigation into the business practices of Carvana, LLC, ensuring accountability and appropriate action to rectify the situation. Additionally, I urge the bureau to take necessary steps to prevent Carvana, LLC from engaging in similar deceptive and unfair practices with other consumers.

As a satisfactory resolution, I am requesting redress for the financial losses I have incurred due to Carvana, LLC 's actions. This includes reimbursement for the costs associated with the defective vehicle, repair expenses, and any additional damages suffered as a direct result of their unfair business practices and contractual breaches. Furthermore, I request that the bureau implement measures to prevent Carvana, LLC from perpetuating such deceptive conduct in the future.

Thank you, Upgrade Customer Support I did NOT apply for a loan. I clicked on the "" Click Here '' link that took me to a page with a list of documents, all dated XX/XX/XXXX. In my name were the following documents : -Terms of Use Agreement -ESIGN Act Consent Agreement -Credit Profile Authorization Agreement -Upgrade Privacy Notice Agreement -Adverse Action Notice Upon seeing this, I became even more worried and called the company. The representative I spoke to said she saw "" nothing in her system '' in my name and just not to worry about it. I asked, "" How can you not see anything? I am on your website and see all of these documents in my name. '' They proceeded to search a different way ( my social security number, address, etc. ) and still "" found nothing. '' They said for me to call the credit bureau about it, even though they said my credit was not looked at. ( How can a loan decision be made without looking at my credit? ) I requested to speak to their supervisor. The supervisor, XXXX, came to the phone and after our conversation of me explaining the situation, told me that she would escalate this and put it into an investigation. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, they responded in email to my concern, writing : "" We have reviewed the details of your claim. According to our records, an application was submitted in your name. We have corrected our internal records and canceled the application in our system. No further action is required. '' So, they confirmed there WAS an application submitted in my name but told me nothing about how this has happened and how/if my social security number and personal information was compromised. Clearly if there is a loan application in my name, and I did not initiate it, there is fraud happening. I wrote back and stated their reply was not okay and asked, HOW was an application submitted in my name. 

On XX/XX/XXXX ( their email is dated XX/XX/XXXX ) they wrote again, responding, "" We understand your concern regarding this matter. Unfortunately, we do not provide information on how we determine our findings to consumers. '' This is completely unacceptable to me. I need to know if my information has been compromised or not, if they have been negligent, and how they will resolve this and ensure of my consumer protection. Of further concern, I received an email last month stating the same thing about a loan being denied, but got sidetracked and did not follow up on the matter until I received a second loan denial this month.

I divorced in XXXX ; I provided XXXX XXXX my divorce decree which stated I was responsible for paying the remaining balance of the joint line of credit. XXXX XXXX required me to open a new account ( as an individual account ) but would not allow for me to refinance the debt in my name only. Instead, they locked the line of credit, requiring pay down of the debt and reassured me no additional funds could be drawn against the line. I continued to make regular payments in order to satisfy the debt. 
In XXXX, Flagstar Bank acquired XXXX XXXX. The original line of credit came over from XXXX XXXX as a Locked line of credit ; pay down only along with my checking account. This fact has been verified several times by employees of Flagstar Bank. 

In early XXXX, without my authorization, consent or knowledge Flagstar Bank re-opened the line of credit. In re-opening the line of credit, they allowed my now ex-wife to make withdraws in excess of {$5000.00}. Flagstar confirmed the withdrawals were initiated online and transferred to an account she had direct access to. Flagstar Bank was complicit in the fraud, they allowed for her to change the mailing and billing address, making me completely unaware of what was taking place. I was notified by Flagstars collection department regarding the minimum payments that I was making were less than the requirement from the billing cycle. I immediately called banking representatives and spent countless hours on the phone and in the branch trying to rectify the situation. I paid Flagstar bank the remaining portion of the original amount I owed ( what was transferred over from XXXX XXXX ) approximately {$1200.00}. And further explained collection efforts should not involve me as the liability is on the lender due to their negligent handling of the loan. 

Flagstar has been less than helpful and is claiming I owe the full balance which is outside of my original loan agreement with XXXX XXXX.

The payment for the washer, dryer, extended warranty, and taxes and fees, was XXXX, and I was told no interest if paid in full, and if not, the interest amount would be charged from the original purchase date. I paid the amount a month later for the financing via using their online website, as they said via email their would be a bill that I would receive with my account numbers, interest amounts, etc. I was traveling, and paid the amount near XXXX PST, despite living in GA at the time I was traveling. I called TD a few days after, in order to get the late fee waived, and they said to just wait until the end of the year when I had finished making the payments toward the principal balance due and that I would essentially be given the offer for a late fee waiver at the end- this was after hours of hold times, so I just took their words at face value. Today, they marked my credit negatively for a late payment as they charged a late fee ( that I was told would be waived ), that applied toward the balance and triggered my interest to be charged as it was no longer considered deferred, despite my making 12 payments in the amount of XXXX XXXX totaling to XXXX, which was actually more than the actual retail cost after taxes of the washer and dryer. I called TD Bank, and the representative told me that their agents had not made adequate notations in their system of my prior calls, despite them having records of one call later on where we discussed that same late payment, where they called me and I answered because I could not get in touch with anyone. They have called me 4 times daily for the last 2 months in efforts to get their debt resolved, I say that with quotes because it was something they imposed, if they wanted me to pay the late fee - fine, but there should be no reason penalties are ADDED to the principal balance when the only reason I did not argue further was because the representative told me it could be waived when I was done paying it at the end of the year. The balance due was XXXX, and I paid XXXX, leaving the XXXX late fee as well as any interest incurred on it to the statement to be waived by customer service. Now, they are saying it is a valid charge because I did not pay the full amount, though the {$1500.00} was actually more than the amount I financed from TD Bank.

I received an approval from One Main Financial. When the representative contacted me, we discussed how I had planned to use my funds and reassured me that this would be a great loan and would help me out. Initially, I was looking for a {$15000.00} loan, but she convinced me that they could give me a larger loan amount and I could pay off my car and have extra cash for emergency needs. She said that they would have to keep my car as collateral and it would be a secured loan. At that time, I believe I only owed, {$8000.00} on my car. She said that it would be a five-year-loan. 

When I went into the office to sign the documents, the loan agreement showed an APR of 26.94 % .The amount financed was {$26000.00}. My monthly payments would be {$810.00} per month over a five-year-period. I noticed that very little was being applied to my principal ( averaging about {$11.00} per month ) and the remainder was going to interest. I contacted XXXX from One Main inquiring why was so little being applied to my principal ; she said, the first couple of years, most of the interest is paid off and later more money would be applied to the principal. Well, needless to say, I now have had this loan for nearly four years as of XX/XX/XXXX, and the interest is still at an unbelievably high interest rate. A couple months ago, I had to double up on my payment, because I got behind. I paid over {$1600.00} and only {$4.00} was applied to the principal! I started downloading my monthly statements, and noticed that this company has been ripping me off for years. As of today, my balance is {$21000.00}. Apparently, I have 15 months to pay off the loan, which is not going to happen, according to their exorbitant interest rates and predatory lending practices, because as of today, I only paid off {$5300.00}. 

When the pandemic hit, I got behind with my payments, because I had a XXXX XXXX, and had to quit my part-time job. I'm XXXX and on a fixed income and had been struggling financially, so every day that you're late, they charge {$15.00} per day, which has happened to me on numerous occasions, so my monthly payment averages over {$900.00}.

I had contacted One Main and they had put me on a deferred payment plan, which made matters worse, because the "" interest '' is still accumulating. I called One Main to see what they could do to help me with this and explained to them my situation.

The original bank, XXXX XXXX XXXX, had offered me the HELOC as a way to keep me and my very small business covered during lean times. It worked very well for me. Renewal/extension was always a pretty straightforward matter and the loan officers then were helpful. Simmons Bank took over XXXX XXXX ( then XXXX ) a few years ago. I am now XXXX XXXX XXXX and the HELOC was going to reach maturity. I supplied many pieces of information. The process continued to drag on due to delays on their end ( e.g. asking for one piece of info and then a week later, another ) with an XX/XX/XXXX maturity date looming. They discovered two small liens totaling around {$7000.00}, the result of a wonderful program offered by the XXXX of XXXX MO to help low-income homeowners get needed repairs to their homes. The loan for seniors like myself was zero interest with zero payments and only payable if the house changed hands. 

I am filing a complaint because when time ran short on the renewal, the unnamed underwriter instructed XXXX XXXX, the person who was emailing me, to suggest that I, at XXXX and on Social Security, with an admittedly low income, use the remainder of the HELOC to pay that off. Why? So that Simmons Bank could be # 2 to collect on a default of the mortgage or loss of the house, rather than # 4. Thereby putting a person of my age under the unnecessary burden of paying interest of 7.5 % or more on a loan offered by the City that was meant to be zero interest, zero payments. Preying on low-income seniors! Giving terrible advice, as well. 

Next, my son wired the funds to pay off the HELOC on XX/XX/XXXX and Simmons held the excess funds from the wire for 2 weeks. No one asked me what I wanted done with the excess. No one contacted me about the excess at all. When I inquired as to the whereabouts of the money, I was told that it would be put into a cashier 's check and mailed to me, instead of simply putting it into my account. On XX/XX/XXXX, I told both XXXX XXXX and the then named loan officer, XXXX XXXX, that I wanted it put into my account. They wrote a cashier 's check, regardless, and because I called and expressed my extreme frustration and anger, the money was finally put into my account.

We were told that though it could be up to 90 days before we were operational, more than likely it would be six weeks. The inaccurate schedule changes began, along with flat out lies regarding permitting. Our XXXX XXXX contract would begin requiring payments 90 days from contract date, not to worry the system should be operational by then. 
Well, it was a couple of days over four months that the system was turned on, though no one told us how to work with it.

First we learned that our system, as currently built, would never be able to operate as we were told by XXXX.

I believe that AMERINAT and XXXX has engaged in several practices that are unfair, deceptive, or otherwise illegal. 
I'm a XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  and my medallion loan was transferred by my original lender to XXXX and Amerinat - Loan servicing company. 
Firstly, when the COVID-19 pandemic hit, the lender contacted me over the phone /email and offered a modified payment plan that allowed me to make reduced payments for a period of time. However, on XX/XX/2023, statement, I discovered that the modified payment plan has caused my loan to mature earlier than originally scheduled. The lender did not adequately inform me of the impact that the modified payment plan would have on the maturity date of my loan and did mail the XXXX bill on time. As a result of the short notice, I had to borrow money from private individuals at a high interest rate in order to pay off the loan and the closing costs. This has put me in a difficult financial position. 
Secondly, AMERINAT overcharged me for closing costs associated with my loan. I believe that these fees are excessive and do not accurately reflect the actual costs associated with the loan. I have attempted to resolve this issue. 
but have not receive a satisfactory explanation for the closing cost. I received. 
a statement that the lender had reallocated my principal and interest. 
payments for prior years in a manner that is not in line with the terms of the loan agreement. Specifically, a greater percentage of my payments was. 
reallocated towards interest than principal. This reallocation of payments is a violation of my rights as a borrower. 
I would also appreciate any assistance that the department can provide in resolving these issues with the lender. As a borrower, I expect to be treated fairly and with transparency, and I do not believe that Amerinat has lived up to these expectations. 
Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to hearing back from you soon.",None,"AMERINATIONAL COMMUNITY SERVICES, INC.",NY,11229,None,Consent provided,Web,07/17/23,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,7261885

One problem is I have spent hours on the phone with Regions trying to dispute this - and they could not even find this account.

Problem 2 is that I have two personal lines of credit reporting - 1 which is fine, and this one, which shows missed payments, etc. that I have been trying to dispute directly with Regions with no success. 

Problem 3 is that this personal line of credit was tied directly to my bank account. Even if I accidentally 'missed ' a payment- the agreement was it would be automatically deducted from my personal account, so I should not have missed any payments just off this alone.

Problem 4 is I have disputed this with the 3 credit bureaus, and Regions confirmed that the reporting is correct. The attached show what is being reported, and there are a lot of discrepancies. Under the FCPA, confirming inaccurate reporting should result in them removing these items under my protection by this law. 

XXXX shows the account was opening in XXXX XXXX- but the first reporting is on XXXX on XXXX with me being 30 days late, and ends with a line for XX/XX/XXXX ( during COVID as well ), with me being 120 days late.

The loan was initiated on XX/XX/XXXX for the amount of {$2000.00} and first payment due on XX/XX/XXXX. 

When we were discussing the monthly payments and interest rate, we were informed that it was about 16 %, and that we would receive the loan information sheet, listing the loan amount, interest rate and number of monthly payments due via email. 

In an attempt to lower the extremely high 16 % interest rate being charged, we inquired with the representatives of Affirm if we could make additional principal payments each month to pay down the loan sooner than the schedule 12 months and thus lower the total interest payments without penalty, and were informed that this was an option. We never received a statement or email outlining the monthly payments indicating the amount applied to principal and interest, however proceeded to make payments in excess of the minimum payment due, each on or before the due date ( the XXXX of each month ), In addition to the minimum payments, our account was credited a refund in the amount of {$130.00} on XX/XX/XXXX, at which time our monthly payments were not adjusted to reflect the new financed amount to be {$1900.00}. 

I have an amortization spreadsheet documenting each payment and according to our records, our payments should have reduced interest paid, however in actuality we paid {$460.00} instead of the scheduled {$350.00} which represents an increase of 44.71 % of the original amount of {$350.00} ( 74.7 % ). 

We reached out to Affirm and were told that in order to pay this loan off in full we needed to make the additional payment of {$100.00} to avoid future interest payments. At which point we opted to pay the amount to stop these interest payments and file a complaint/review with your bureau. 

I have a list of our payments, and the initial "" loan documents '' from Affirm for your review if needed.

They did not have access to see the line of credit, and so when I stressed that I wanted to make sure it was paid off, they assured me all my debts were paid. 

Because the line of credit was not accessible to the teller, the line was not paid off, and the interest and fees continued to accrue.

Eagle Loan of Ohio XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, OH XXXX. Phone XXXX Attorney XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, OH XXXX. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, OH XXXX. Phone XXXX. Case # XXXX. 

XXXX XXXXXXXX is legally represented by XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX, OH XXXX Phone : XXXX or XXXX. 

XX/XX/XXXX I was off work on short term XXXX due to having XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX. While off work my pay was reduced and I got behind on my Eagle Loan. 

I went to Eagle loan multiple times tring to get them to take a partial payment or to move the late payment to the end of the loan so that I could stay current on my loan and in good standing with them. I had, had several loans with Eagle Loan in the past and paid them all off. 

However, Eagle loan absolutely would not work with me in anyway shape or form. They wanted that payment plus intrest. They told me I could either pay it in full or else they were going to go to small claims court with it. 

At the time due to Eagle Loans refusal to work with me, I thought a court ordered garnishment would setup a reasonable payment/garnishment amount for the under {$1000.00} that I owed Eagle Loan and that would solve my problems with getting Eagle Loan refusing to accept payment. 

XX/XX/XXXX Attorney XXXX XXXX, on behalf of Eagle Loan filed a garnishment against me with the XXXX XXXX XXXX. 

When I received the notification that they had requested a hearing, I was mistakenly relieved, thinking that the court was just going to order reasonable payments for less than {$1000.00}. I had no objection too and therefore did not attend the hearing. Huge mistake on my part. 

XX/XX/XXXX the judgment was entered with the court in favor of Eagle loan for a whopping {$3000.00} with accruing interest rate of 25 %. 

XX/XX/XXXX I was served a copy of the judgment. And was devastated to see that Eagle Loan had asked for and was awarded {$3000.00} with an additional accumulating outrageous interest rate of 25 %. On a loan that had a bal of under {$1000.00}. Three times the value of the loan. 

I say that I owe them under {$1000.00} because I can not give the exact figure that I owed them. Due to Eagle Loan did not issue monthly statements, monthly bills, nor did they have an online access where I could monitor my monthly payments and interest balance. At the time of the loan, Eagle Loan required that my payments be automatically taken from my bank account. However, there were times that I paid them early in cash by going to their local office. Due to Eagle Loan not providing any paper or digital documentation of payments and monthly balance. I am uncertain about the exact number that I owe. I just know that it was somewhere between XXXX and {$900.00} continually fluctuating to predatory interest rates. Therefore I am certain due to the amount of payments that I had already made on the loan, that I owed under {$1000.00}. And absolutely nowhere near the {$3000.00} that Eagle Loan was granted. 

The only documentation I was ever given by Eagle loan was my original loan contract. Which sadly I do not still have. 

Upon receiving the court order, I immediately called the XXXX Municipal Court and requested a hearing. I advised the courts Clerk that the exorbitant over inflated amount that Eagle Loan had presented to them was in excess of over 3 times the actual value of the loan. 

The courts Clerk stated, that since I did not show up for the hearing, I could not contest this amount and they would not schedule a hearing. And that they would be taking the {$3000.00} through payroll garnishment and did not need any consent from me to do so. 

All dates and amounts listed below I found on the XXXX Municpal Courts website on XX/XX/XXXX, by looking up my name. There is no reflected balance list anywhere on this website. 

XX/XX/XXXX order of garnishment was served upon XXXX XXXX XXXX my employer at the time. 

XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX responded to Municipal Court advising that they would begin the garnishment XX/XX/XXXX I contacted the Municipal Court again and again requested a hearing. This time due to the Covid epidemic they did schedule a hearing for XX/XX/XXXX but instead of allowing me to appear due to the Covid restrictions, I had to submit an affidavit to speak for myself, since the court was not permitting in person hearings. 

XX/XX/XXXX of XXXX, XXXX Municipal Court received according to their own online records {$340.00} for which the court assigned a receipt number of XXXX. 

XX/XX/XXXX the magistrate at the XXXX Municipal Court ordered that my garnishment be stayed until the end of the pandemic which they estimated to be XX/XX/XXXX of XXXX. And that all monies the court had already received out of my check, be returned to me. 

XX/XX/XXXX the magistrates decision was filed an excepted by the court XX/XX/XXXX a copy of the stay of garnishment was mailed to the XXXX XXXX XXXX, my employer, myself, and attorney XXXX. 

XX/XX/XXXX XXXX Municipal Court received another payment from my employer as the payment was issued prior to my employer, acknowledging receipt of the stay of garnishment. By the XXXX Municipal Court 's online record they received {$370.00} on this date and issued a receipt # XXXX XX/XX/XXXX the XXXX Municipal Court returned to me the two payments that they had received. One for {$340.00} and the second for {$340.00} to equal {$720.00}. 

XX/XX/XXXX the XXXX XXXX XXXX  automatically without a new order of the court, started deducting from my payroll check again. 

XX/XX/XXXX the XXXX Municipal Court received a sum of {$430.00} and assigned it receipt number XXXX. 

XX/XX/XXXX of XXXX the XXXX Municipal Court received the sum of {$410.00} and assigned it the receipt number of XXXX. 

XX/XX/XXXX of XXXX attorney, XXXX filed a motion with the court to restart my payroll deductions that had already been restarted and the court had already received two payments since XX/XX/XXXX. Thereby causing unnecessary court costs. 

XX/XX/XXXX the magistrate ruled on attorney XXXX motion to lift the stay of my garnishment and to begin taking out payroll deductions. Which had already begun to be taken since XX/XX/XXXX of XXXX. 

XX/XX/XXXX that XXXX Municipal Court received a third payment in the sum of {$450.00} and a signed receipt number XXXX XX/XX/XXXX that XXXX Municipal Court received the fourth payment in the sum of {$440.00} and assigned a receipt number of XXXX XX/XX/XXXX XXXX Municipal Court issued check number XXXX to attorney XXXX XXXX. The payment sums included in this check totaled {$1700.00} as listed on the XXXX Municipal Court website. 

XX/XX/XXXX XXXX Municipal Court received the sum of {$450.00} and assigned a receipt number of XXXX XX/XX/XXXX of XXXX that XXXX Municipal Court received a sum of {$500.00} and assigned a receipt number of XXXX. 

XX/XX/XXXX XXXX Municipal Court issued a second check to attorney XXXX check number XXXX to include sums equaling {$940.00}. When added to the XX/XX/XXXX payment attorney XXXX received of {$1700.00}. Brought XXXX XXXX is total Ive received monies to {$2600.00}. 

Upon adding together, all of the total sums that the XXXX Municipal Court list on their website as payments received to include receipt numbers for those payments, the XXXX Municipal Court received a grand total of {$2700.00} between XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX. To which they distributed to XXXX XXXX, {$2600.00}. leaving a {$37.00} unlisted destinations. 

According to XXXX XXXX XXXX pay stub for XXXX XXXX dated XX/XX/XXXX it shows a grand total of {$3400.00} as being withheld from XXXX XXXX pay and pay to the order of the XXXX municipal courthouse to be distributed to attorney XXXX. 

The withholdings of XXXX XXXX class XX/XX/XXXX paycheck show that on this day no further deductions were being withheld from XXXX XXXX pay. The total year today sum of {$3400.00} exceeded the court ordered amount to be paid of {$3000.00}. 

It was XXXX XXXX believe that as of that date her debt to include all intrest, fines, fees, and penalties due to the XXXX Municipal Court and or attorney. XXXX XXXX on behalf of Eagle Loan was satisfied, and that this debt was no more with a XXXX amount due. 

After this day, XXXX XXXX made several separate attempts over the next two years to have Eagle loan status on her credit report updated to Paid in Full and/or removed from her credit reports. XXXX XXXX did provide to all three credit reporting agencies copies of the paystub, showing they mailed that withheld, as well as the copy of the total amount to be withheld. All three credit reporting agencies did contact Eagle loanXXXX. XXXX on several separate occasions between the dates of XX/XX/XXXX through XX/XX/XXXX. With XXXXXXXX XXXX request to have the information updated to Paid in Full and/or removed from her credit report or. While each time Eagle loan/attorney, XXXX responded to the credit bureau , that they did not want the debt removed from the report, they never updated it with any amount due. None of the 3 major Credit Reporting agencies ever reflected the alleged remaining balance due of {$390.00}. 
The difference between the {$3000.00} ( 3 x 's the value of the original loan ) that was awarded to them by the court and the {$2600.00} that the court lists that they actually distributed to them. 

At one point during this two-year period, XXXX XXXX even filed a complaint with the XXXX XXXX XXXX  about Eagle loans account still showing on her credit reports. The XXXX XXXX XXXX  whom also contacted Eagle Loan but never advised XXXX XXXX of any Balance. 

At no time between XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX did Eagle loan, XXXX XXXX or the XXXX Municipal Court make any attempt to contact XXXX XXXXXXXX about this amount. Nor did they attempt to collect it through any payroll deductions. Eagle LoanXXXX XXXX did have XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX  contact information as it is listed on the credit report disputes that XXXX XXXXXXXX repeatedly kept Initiating. Thereby, proving that XXXX XXXX had NO knowledge of any remaining balance. 

Quiet unethically Attorney XXXX Sat on the {$390.00} bal allowing the 25 % interest rate to grow over the more than 2 yrs time frame. 

XX/XX/XXXX with rent due on this pay date XXXX XXXXXXXX checked here banking app for her employer paid direct deposit, only to find the deposit was short {$330.00}. 

XXXX XXXX contacted her employer who informed her that the missing {$330.00} was sent to the XXXX Municipal Court for a {$3000.00} garnishment that was due to Eagle loan. XXXX XXXX explained that this debt had been satisfied back in XX/XX/XXXX and that she did not owe Eagle Loan any monies. 

XXXX XXXXXXXX then went on the XXXX Municipal Court website to research the matter, and when she looked up the old case she found. The above dates and sums along with the below information. 

XX/XX/XXXX attorney XXXX filed for a garnishment against XXXX XXXX through the XXXX Municipal Court. XXXX XXXX was never notified of this filing by the court nor by attorney XXXX, nor by her employer over this court date, filing, order or ect. 

XX/XX/XXXX the order of garnishment was sent to XXXX XXXX 's employer XXXX in XXXX, Ohio. 

XX/XX/XXXX the order of garnishment was delivered to XXXX and XXXX Ohio. 

Only after speaking to her employer on XX/XX/XXXX did XXXX XXXX find out about the court order and was then and only then sent a copy from her employer of the documentation that they had received from the XXXX Municipal Court.

XX/XX/XXXX after much research on the XXXX Municipal Court website finding the listing of the payments that the court received and distributed as well as the receipt numbers that went along with them and after doing her own calculations of what was received and distributed did XXXX XXXX find that the XXXX Municipal Court had only distributed to attorney XXXX {$2600.00} and not the total withholdings from her paycheck of {$3400.00}. 

After speaking with a clerk at the XXXX Municipal CourXXXX, XXXX XXXX was advised that the new court order was for XXXX XXXX to pay {$1900.00} in interest on the {$390.00} bal. Plus the court ordered an additional 25 % interest rate to be added to and continue to accumulate on top of the {$1900.00}. The clerk also advised XXXX XXXX that on top of this she would owe Court costs, Attorney fees, fines & penalties that would also be deducted from her paycheck. At the sum of 25 % of her total pay to be taken out of each paycheck until the debt and all associated fees, fines, penalties and etc., along with the continuing 25 % interest rate that continues to raise the balance due on a daily basis. 

As of todays date, XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX has already paid to the order of Eagle loan company/XXXX XXXXXXXX three times the amount of the original debt. With this new court, filing the current balance that they are demanding, not accounting for the continuing accruing, 25 % interest is two times the original amount of the debt. As it currently stands, if this new order is allowed to stand, XXXX XXXX will be paying well over {$6000.00} in total or more for a loan debt that was originally under {$1000.00}. 

XXXX XXXX while having full ability to contact XXXX XXXX or any of her employers over the past two years. Instead, let this amount grow into yet another payday for himself and Eagle Loan out of what shouldve been an already satisfied debt. 

This behavior is blatant, obvious predatory, lending and reasonably, should be considered unethical, and at the very least borderline illegal as this would be an est 600 % interest on the original debt and continuing to climb. 

As of todays date, the XXXX Municipal Court is currently in possession of {$330.00} recieved from garnishment of XXXX XXXX pay on XX/XX/XXXX, to be distributed to XXXX XXXX. If the remainder owed of the {$3000.00} was {$390.00} that would leave a {$57.00} owed on the original court order. Without intervention from an oversee authority the next garnishment payment will be taken from XXXX XXXX 's pay roll on XX/XX/XXXX at the sum of 25 % of her total pay. 

This Garnishment has caused an immediate hardship and emergency situation for XXXX XXXX whom is the head of household and her income from XXXX is her Only financial support. XXXX XXXX does not receive any form of financial assistance and goes without any medical coverage due to the high premiums. XXXX XXXX lives paycheck to paycheck barely able to make ends meet with her full pay check.

07/25/23,"Payday loan, title loan, or personal loan",Installment loan,Problem when making payments,None,"Re : SAGO Financial XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Hello : This is to advise you of an illegal incident that I experienced in dealing with Sago Financial and XXXX. Sago was used to finance my RV by the dealership XXXX XXXX  Sago uses XXXX to process their payments. 

The first unethical and legal action they conducted was the harassment of my entire family. The payment was due on the 7th, and if I did not pay on the 7th exactly they began their trail of harassment. Even though I have never missed a payment, I have never gone more than 14 days past the due date, they still stalked my family and myself as if I were 2 or more months behind. They reached out to people I did not list as a reference and quite frankly I don't know how they obtained contact information for my family members. They reached out to my brother, my nephew and even my second cousin. As a result I communicated with them in writing that this behavior was unethical, and also filed a complaint with the Better Business Bureau. These actions seem to stop that behavior and I was also very clear with them about when I expected to submit payment. I asked them to actually change my due date but they refused. I continued to make regular payments in a timely manner, and was never late or missed a payment. 

The reason for my correspondence today is because they have been caught illegally storing my banking information, and withdrew funds from my account without my permission. I did not have automatic payments turned on at any time throughout this process. The banking information was accessible only to me when submitting the payment. I manually submitted every payment and at no time gave them permission to store my banking information to use at their discretion. I never authorized the institution verbally or in writing that they had authorization to withdraw funds. The exact event happened on XX/XX/XXXX. I had communicated with Sago over text that I would be submitting my payment on the XXXX. I was out of town so my first opportunity to submit payment was on the XXXX. I was about to submit payment when I recognized that the payment had already been made and cleared my bank. I only advised them I would make the payment at that date as I have always advised them and always submitted the manual payment myself. Sago illegally withdrew the funds from my bank account on the XXXX. I immediately contacted my bank, based in XXXX XXXX  XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ; and alerted them to the fraudulent action. I asked for the funds to be recovered and stop payment on any future attempts to withdraw money but this organization. 

This was the final straw. Although I certainly don't want any negativity on my credit, I can not continue to deal with this organizations ' immoral and unethical and completely illegal actions. I communicated in writing for them that I wanted to do a voluntary repossession so I would not be involved with this financial any longer. The camper is in great shape and has lojack so they know exactly where it is stored. 

I would like to know what actions I can take through this organization in terms of harassment, but more importantly, so others do not ever fall victim to this predatory lender. They made me feel as if I had contracted a loan with a loan shark or the mafia. I want to prevent others from having this same experience. I am also seeking information about what I can do to limit the damage on my credit report. Please advise and thanks so much for your assistance in the disturbing matter.

My brother died in XXXX of XXXX. He had a motorcycle that he had financed in XX/XX/XXXX. He still had a balance of XXXX XXXX. We began paying the loan. I called Synchrony Bank to report the death of my brother, and I sent a death certificate. I didn't hear from them, and I didn't want them to come after my mother-in-law, so I started paying the loan. In XXXX of XXXX, I called Synchrony Bank and requested a payoff amount.

I waited for the title, and when it did not arrive, I called Synchrony Bank again ( 2nd call ). I was told at that time I had a XXXXXXXX XXXX balance that needed to be paid to release the title. I asked them how I could have a balance when I paid it off over the phone with their agent. It made no sense. I just paid it because it wasn't worth the aggravation. So again, I was told the title would be released in 10 days ; it is now XXXX. Again, I did not receive the title. I called Synchrony Bank again ( 3rd call ) and spoke to someone in the probate department. I was then told AGAIN that I had a XXXX balance.

I paid EVERY PAYMENT and a ridiculous amount of interest and ALWAYS ON TIME, and they won't provide me with the title over a XXXX XXXX late fee, which I now know they shouldn't have been collecting any money from me since it was my brother 's loan, and he was dead. So, this whole time, 5 years, I have been paying off his loan, not knowing that I didn't have to. I called Synchrony Bank again ( XXXX time ) and reached the probate department. The probate department told me I wasn't financially responsible for the loan, which would have been nice to know 5 years ago. Again, I was told that the XXXX $ would be waived and that the case was sent over to the title department and my title would be released. I still have not received the title. I came home yesterday and had another bill from Synchrony Bank for XXXX. I called Synchrony Bank again ( 6th time ). I made it through the matrix and was sent to a probate specialist.

I asked how can I get a statement from you for XXXX and mention NOTHING of the XXXX charges. This agent, XXXX # XXXX listened to me and proceeded to take some action, which I greatly appreciated.

In XX/XX/XXXX, I applied for a personal loan to get better terms on a title loan with outrageous terms and over 1000 % interest. I was mislead during the process with another business and just wanted a decent interest rate and a set term to repay the debt. I applied to One Main financial online. I was contacted by the XXXX office and told I was accepted for a loan. General terms were mentioned on the call but nothing could be provided or discussed without a sit down face to face meeting. I made appointment with XXXX, and met with her on XX/XX/XXXX, at the address in XXXXXXXX XXXX She provided the terms and optional coverages. She gave me a printed copy of the disclosures, Truth in Lending, Loan Terms, Arbitration Agreement, total 6 pages. A loan offer summary, same date and loan number. Loan proceeds disbursements authorization form, same date and loan number. A copy of application for loan with addendum to application, completed online, 4 pages. Truth in lending insurance disclosure, same date and loan number which was refused as optional. Statement regarding Debt Consolidation same date and loan number, ( statement only, not signed or numbered as part of loan documents ), 3 pages of documentation on sharing personal information between financial companies, what they share, and things you can limit. A copy of Credit Report generated by OneMain, giving me my score and general information. A information sheet describing DAILY SIMPLE INTEREST, how it works and how it is calculated. A information sheet describing OneMain Financial Customer Referral Program Terms and Conditions. 3 pages, Optional Product Choices, not signed, description of each product offered, ( refused all optional products ), ELECTRONIC Consent agreement, UNSIGNED.

ALL THE ABOVE NOTED DOCUMENTS ARE UPLOADED IN THIS COMPLAINT After signing documents, I was asked to wait while they initiated the payoff of my car, and initiated the cash advance to my bank account. Then XXXX came to say, I needed to contact my insurance company to reduce my deductible on my full coverage insurance to a lower deductible to finish the loan. This was not discussed and they had my insurance information prior to signing the loan documents. I was caught off guard and I simply called my insurance and made the requested change and added OneMain as a Lien holder as they required the car as collateral. This increased my premium on my insurance. Not something I anticipated or was informed about till after documents were signed. It was inconvenient and upsetting but I let it slide. 

I made my first payment and each months payment well ahead of the monthly due date of the XXXX XXXX of every month. The following are the dates of all payments made on this loan XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX early payment ) All statements documents are also uploaded in this complaint. 

I began to see the principal and interest figures did not appear to be correct. As normally a loan first payments will be higher interest and lower principal reduction. This slowly changes over time as a general rule. These figures did not follow that pattern. I questioned the local office in a phone call, and was not successful in getting any info, and referred to the main ONEMAIN Financial offices. 

I contacted customer service and had a gentleman look over the documents, noting first that the truth in lending sheet states Amount financed is {$5000.00} APR 30.37 % for 48 months {$180.00} by XXXX of each month. SHOWING IN THE BOXES UNDER SECTION A. TRUTH IN LENDING DISCLOSURES. 

However on Page 4 under INTEREST BEARING LOAN, states principal plus interest computed on the daily unpaid principal balance as set forth below THE CASH ADVANCE IS {$5100.00} the annual rate of interest is : 29.16 % on the unpaid principal balance Then a statement below this of how interest is computed applying a single equivalent daily rate under Texas Finance Code. This interest rate may not be the same as the APR. You figure the Finance Charge by applying the true daily earnings method as defined by the Texas Finance Code to the unpaid portion of the cash advance. You base the Finance Charge and Total of Payments as if I will make each payment on the day it is due. You will apply payments on the date they are received. This may result in a different Finance Charge or Total of Payments. My final payment may be larger or smaller than my regular payment. 

This interest rate is the Contract Rate.

All payments will be applied in the following order. First comes other charges provided for in Agreement or allowed by law and late charges. Second comes interest accrued to the date the payment is received and applied by Lender. Third, any remainder goes to the unpaid Principal balance. If I pay early, more of the payment will go to the unpaid Principal balance. If I pay late or miss payments, more of the payment will go to interest. This will delay my Principal reduction and cost me more.

PRINCIPAL. principal is the total of the Amount Financed plus any Prepaid Finance Charges that I have financed. Principal does not include late charges or returned check charges. The amount of Principal is {$5100.00} The gentleman with OneMain reviewing the documents sees the irregularity and is also confused. I then ask him about the principal and interest variation and not being more in line with expectations on any loan reductions in interest charges accruing and in reduction of principal! No rhyme or reason to the fluctuation. He then begins to get frustrated with me insisting on getting an explanation and there is no resolution. A few days later I get a call from a senior manager who says he is calling to answer any questions and resolve my inquiries. He is very rude, dismissive and absolutely no help, as he insists this is all normal practice. The holidays come and Im dealing with many issues, including health related. I drop this issue and continue to make payments from my checking account direct to OneMain before my due date every month! 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I remove a security freeze on my credit for a one week period to apply for credit Im interested in to get lower interest rates for other purposes. I come across a offer for a loan with ONEMAIN at a interest rate of 22 % to 28 %. So I apply just like any first time applicant would. Did not state anywhere on loan application of intended combining a current loan or amount of any credit line amount needed. I was contacted about 4 days later by a XXXX, from ONEMAIN from XXXX office. She says I was approved. Tells me it will pay off my current loan and then offered a large cash advance payment! I told her I was not asking to combine the loan and it was a application for credit as a stand alone! She seems confused and I ask if the manager is there. She is not and says they will call me back! Another couple of days, XXXX the branch manager tries to call and leaves a voicemail message to return the call. I return the call on XX/XX/XXXX. I originally get XXXX again and after conversation I ask for XXXX. After a few minutes XXXX and I go over the offer verbally. 
These are notes from that conversation. 

Says approved for Secured up to {$14000.00} 57 months interest 22.77 %. OR UNSECURED up to {$10000.00} 57 months interest 25.17 % Requires {$500.00} minimum cash advance to get loan. 

XXXX then asks what my goal is, get unsecured, lowest interest rate, shortest term to get less than 30 % interest loan re financed! 

Then offers this 36 months {$5200.00} loan payoff + {$500.00} cash advance, interest XXXX payment XXXX depending on optional coverage OR 24 months {$5200.00} loan payoff+ {$500.00} cash advance interest XXXX payments $ XXXX depending on optional coverage STATES NO ADMINISTRATIVE FEE AS IN XXXX XXXX 

Im thinking I get title back, says should take approximately 30-45 days to receive from state mailed to me, can drop added insurance coverage they demanded after loan documents signed, its unsecured loan, would be slightly less interest for a shorter term 24 months, not 48. 

End of conversation set appointment for XXXXXXXX XXXX XX/XX/XXXX same day! Get call from XXXX a hour later message to call her unknown reason! 

Then after requesting a sit down appointment only option to see terms at XXXX XXXX her office, she calls back to say she misstated the interest rates. XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX XXXX I go in at XXXX XXXX  to the office with my original loan documents and my notebook with details I took down during phone conversation and we enter a cubicle! 

First she states what interest rates are for the unsecured option. In phone conversation of today the rates were XXXX secured up to {$14000.00}, 57 months 22.77 % pymts XXXX Unsecured {$10000.00}, 57 months 25.17 % interest pymts XXXX Then XXXX gets on phone , she is branch manager gives these figures Unsecured {$5200.00} 36 months interest XXXX pymt XXXX Unsecured {$5200.00} 24 months interest XXXX pymt XXXX Now Im in her office the rate is {$5200.00}, 24 months, interest XXXX payments XXXX no optional coverages selected! 

I ask why the changes in interest rates, creditworthiness? She says less interest if you get optional coverages. Document says optional coverage has no effect on impact on loan decision. 

All this discussion before we discuss loan documents. 

XXXX Ask what product and terms Im interested in? Lowest interest rate shortest term unsecured so I get my title back since the only option is all Im offered to payoff old loan and take minimum of {$500.00} cash. Only option, will return {$500.00} cash as a payment against principal when received is my intention!

Has me choose options on a computer screen, such as term, 24 months, secured or unsecured, credit protection options. I choose minimum loan amount, 24 months, unsecured, no credit protection option. Did not sign or initial anything and no printed documents to review after 30 minutes. Then she asked for my bank account or debit card, why havent accepted the loan and havent looked at documents? Says its required to print the documents? Ok I gave my debit card, again stating it will be coming straight back as I have no need for {$500.00} cash! Next she arrives with intention of making me read from her computer monitor. I said Im elderly and XXXX and this is uncomfortable I prefer in writing on paper so I can comfortably read them. She argues that is their process to review loan documents! She is starting to get angry and frustrated and I notice she is shaking in her hands holding her paperwork. She informs me on two occasions we need to be professional, and that I am not obligated to continue at any time! I see the red flags clearly but stay respectful and ask for what I need to complete the review!

The first set of printed documents comes back in with her! The first page is a loan agreement and disclosure statement, including the section A TRUTH IN LENDING DISCLOSURE.

APR 29.36 % Finance charge XXXX. Amount financed {$5200.00} TOTAL OF PAYMENTS IF ALL PAYMENTS AS SCHEDULED {$7100.00} 1st payment XXXX due XX/XX/XXXX, then 23 payments {$290.00} monthly beginning XX/XX/XXXX. 

Prepayment : if I pay off early I will not have to pay a penalty for prepaying all or part of a loans principal balance I WILL NOT get a refund or credit of part of the finance charge for a prepayment in full. I WILL NOT receive a refund or credit for a partial prepayment. 

ITEMIZATION OF AMOUNT FINANCED Line 21 {$4700.00}.

Then provides terms and conditions very questionable in nature but general terms not specific to my loan with any notations indicated other than standard. 

The 2nd document is titled Loan Offer summary! I notice both these documents although both dated XX/XX/XXXX, have my same loan number as I signed on XX/XX/XXXX. FISHY! 

This document states my account number XXXX, dated XX/XX/XXXX my name and the following statement I have carefully reviewed the terms of this loan offer. I will obtain all changes in writing before I sign my loan documents. 

THEY REFUSED ME A COPY OF THE DOCUMENTS TO BE PRINTED TO READ, INITIALLY, THEN REFUSED TO LET ME KEEP A COPY OF ANY DOCUMENTS I LOOKED OVER WHILE THERE!

PREADTORY LENDING, fraud, etc!

In closing please understand I have never been late on any payment with this company, since XXXX, paid early every month. Tried to ask questions about {$100.00} admin fee that was left off truth in lending disclosure, but Ive been paying interest on but not on 1st page truth in lending disclosure when I signed in XX/XX/XXXX. Then try to discuss issues with fluctuations in interest and principal with local office and main office headquarters, even with a account manager who called but no resolution just excuses and everything is normal, you signed documents! Now I apply for a XXXX % interest rate without mention of refinance by in good standing customer loan and get another lie, fraud, changing rates, changing terms, cant give me printed documents to read and refused to let me take them home! Cant provide a statement on payment of XX/XX/XXXX and incorrect payoff statement and fraudulent new loan balance starting figure. THIS IS ILLEGAL AND PREDATORY!

I demand, in no uncertain terms, the immediate removal of this damaging entry within the next 7 days. 

The inclusion of this late payment entry on my credit report is an egregious misrepresentation of my financial responsibility and jeopardizes my ability to obtain credit. I can not stress enough the gravity of this matter, as it directly affects my pursuit of a mortgage and other crucial financial endeavors. 

I want to be unequivocally clear : this late payment entry is not a reflection of my financial character or my commitment to meeting my obligations. It is an isolated incident, an anomaly amidst a history of responsible financial conduct. The impact of this entry on my creditworthiness is unwarranted, unjust, and wholly unacceptable.

I demand that Kick Off Lending immediately conduct a thorough investigation into my account and take swift action to rectify this detrimental situation. It is imperative that you promptly remove this late payment entry from my credit report, restoring the accuracy and integrity of my credit history.

I am well aware of the rights and protections afforded to consumers under the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ). Kick Off Lending 's failure to expeditiously address and resolve this matter constitutes a blatant violation of its obligations under the FCRA. I will not tolerate such disregard for my consumer rights and the damaging consequences it has imposed upon me.

I insist that Kick Off Lending provides written confirmation within the next 7 days, unequivocally stating that the late payment entry associated with my account, Account Number : XXXX, has been entirely expunged from my credit report. Anything less than your immediate action to rectify this injustice will leave me with no choice but to pursue all available legal avenues to seek redress and hold Kick Off Lending accountable for its actions.

Furthermore, I implore Kick Off Lending to thoroughly reassess its internal procedures and safeguards to prevent such gross missteps from recurring in the future. Your customers deserve transparent and ethical treatment, along with accurate reporting that upholds their financial well-being and integrity.

I expect and demand the utmost urgency in addressing this matter and an expeditious resolution that fully restores my creditworthiness. Failure to comply within the specified 7-day timeframe will compel me to escalate this matter publicly, share my grievances widely, and seek legal recourse to safeguard my rights and financial future.

I eagerly await your prompt response and the immediate removal of the late payment entry associated with my account, Account Number : XXXX. Time is of the essence, and any delay or indifference on your part will be met with the full extent of legal action and public exposure.

As a result of the closure, my credit score has dropped by XXXX points, making it difficult for me to secure loans or obtain favorable credit terms.

I contracted XXXXXXXX XXXX and 3rd party finance company UCFS ( retail installment contract/ security agreement ) to handle my alleged debt with the IRS XXXX XXXX XXXX  refused to send me the debt validation for the IRS and CONSERVE, so then I asked for a debt validation for their services to analyze why was I being charged that erroneous amount by XXXX XXXX

The breeder suggested XXXX companies for a loan. We applied at both and XXXX got back to us first. They gave me a loan for {$1900.00} and my boyfriend 's was {$2100.00}. We both had our own loans and loan paperwork. At the time of signing the paperwork we never received copies of what we signed even though we were told we would. My loans was set up for by weekly payments of {$110.00} automatically taken from my bank account. By end of XXXX, I had made 10 payments to the loan. At the time, I decided to check the balance to see how much the principal had changed. When I logged into my account. The loan amount had only changed by {$50.00} when I had assumed it was half way paid off. When I started looking at the website that is when I noticed the interest rate of 138.97 % which concerned me. I reached out to XXXX to try and ask questions and I wanted to get a copy of the paperwork, I explained I could not find the paperwork online. The representative told me they couldn't send me my loan contract through email. I told them I wanted it mailed and emailed. But I wanted my paperwork. They continued to argue with me and said I could get it online and I told them it was broken. Which as I kept explaining was not an option. At some point they agreed to mail it to me and I think I received it 2-3 weeks later. When it finally came it wasn't at all what I expected or agreed to when we had started this process. It shows an APR of 138.97 % and total payments of {$5700.00} and a daily interest rate buried in the paper of .3807 %. Which I never would have agreed to. When I called back to dispute the loan and explain something was wrong. They argued with me and failed to listen or help me with my issues. After the conversation, I immediately went to my bank to close my bank account so that no more payments would be made. They finally called me in maybe in late XXXX and XXXX wanting my payment. I again tried to discuss the loan to understand why the all my payments when to interest and didn't touch the principle balance. But all I got was the run around and a request for another payment. I told them I would not pay without a clear understanding of the loan so they said they were going to turn me over to collections. I never received a call from anyone, not them again or a collections company! Now after reviewing my credit report I see a company called XXXX charged off {$4600.00}.

I am a former XXXX XXXX customer and my account has been acquired to your company few years ago. My lease number was # # # # from XXXX then I was assigned to agreement number # # # # upon Spruce acquisition. There are few issues on the recent invoice XXXX and other general issues as below. 

1. Starting this month, I received the invoice with a new Agreement number which is XXXX. I was aware of the change thanks to a letter sent to me last month. Now, the problem is you are billing me {$170.00} instead of {$160.00} which was agreed on the original lease. I see that Spruce began adding State , County and District Tax for the first time. However, the lease agreement states on 2.2. ( b ) Based on current tax rates as of the date you are signing this Lease, the estimated personal property, sales and use taxes you will pay on the monthly Lease Payments during the Term are {$0.00}. I was wondering if this additional charge incurred while updating all your account with the new agreement number. Please, rectify this issue and send me the confirmation. 

2. Your data of the lease solar panel production is bogus because it shows the system continued its production during XXXX and XXXX. However, I renovated my home and the system was uninstalled on XXXX. It was out of service until XX/XX/XXXX when it was reinstalled after the construction was completed. How can the system generate the energy when it was off the grid and was on the ground by pieces. 

3. I tried to sign on the newly designed website and clicked the billing button. It did not work. To be honest, I was never a fan of your web portal because it was poorly designed and maintained from the beginning. When your letter with the new Agreement number mentioned about newly designed web portal and promised Call-back Functionality, I was hoping that would make your customer service experience better because it was never the case in the past. But then again, I tried to resolve the issues by calling and leaving my call back number. No one has called back after a day. I am very disappointed. I created another account with a different email address and a new Agreement number. It did not work either. 

4. I received the text from XXXX saying there was a service appointment to confirm. First, I ignored because the caller area code was from XXXX, CA and thought it was a scam phone call. Later, another text sent had mentioned that the work order was assigned by Spruce Finance. I'd wish if Spruce can do a better job communicating with their customers.

XXXX XXXX is responsible for the remaining balance not me as the bed could not bed used due to their error.

Today XXXX offers me {$220.00} to close the account, this is laughable because the account has already adversely affect my life. Please see snippets of how your company has been showing on my Credit Report.

01/30/23,"Payday loan, title loan, or personal loan",Payday loan,Problem with the payoff process at the end of the loan,None,"Good morning, My name is XXXX XXXX and my phone number is XXXX XXXX XXXX. 
Before I get into telling you what happened please know I work overnights. Im happy to talk by phone. My days off are Tuesday and XXXX  and for me it works best if I can set up a time for us to talk almost like an appointment. Just due to my sleep schedule. This will ensure I do not miss a call or important communication. 

That being said, I want to make a report about ongoing harassment and unethical business practices since XX/XX/XXXX, that I have been dealing with from check city in XXXX ut. 

Last XXXX ( XXXX ) I had taken out a loan for around {$800.00} for car repairs. After XXXX weeks and making only a few payments I injured my spine and was hospitalized and unable to walk properly for several Months. I kept in close contact with them, sent them proof of medical records, made a few small payments I believe and let them know I wanted and desired to pay off the loan as soon as possible, but was waiting on unemployment. However I did not receive unemployment as I did not qualify for unemployment In XX/XX/XXXX I was strong enough to go back to work and still in communication with check city, I let them know I was ready to resume payments. This is when the problem began however. 

Every time I engaged in any conversation, which I did through written communication only due to inappropriate communication as well as the harassment, I was told that the pay date I gave them ( always within a months time of the sent email ) would not be sufficient as I needed to pay them now. I was told they would not take a payment unless it was within that week. 

I would then let them know I could not do that. At one point I was texted several time in one day, after making arrangements, and was still sent texts past 7-9pm at night. I immediately contacted the store manager to inform them of everything going on and still, they stated they wanted a payment then. 

It was around this time, in XXXX, that I was told if I did not make my payments soon and when told, that my file would be sent to collections where I would face a lawsuit. 

This threat continued monthly with the same encounter. I would give a date they could withdrawal for them to only tell me no it had to be done within a week, or it would go to collections. 

Finally In XXXX I responded to the message asking that my file be sent to collections. I was informed it would be sent that day. However it was not and they continued the same game. I asked again in XXXX for it to be sent to collections and explained that it should have been sent the prior month when I was told it would be and still nothing. 

Now it is XX/XX/XXXX and I received another email with the same thing. I said heres the date you can withdrawal, Use the card you have on file. 
I was told no, it has to be now. I then responded with all of this information and explained to them that not only am I a state employee who makes minimal for survival, and budget is very important, but I explained that I am also caring for my mother and cover much of her budget And I really need to be able to make this arrangement and we could do this now or I would contact someone for further assistance on the matter. 

I received an email back stating okay we will set up a withdrawal for the date I gave which was XX/XX/XXXX and was given two ways to pay it off. Once over 4 payments for a total of {$1200.00} or over a year for $ 2400ish.

I responded that I would like to do the 4 payments and again to use the card on file.

When the day came for it to withdrawal I noticed it had not gone out. I went back to my email and an email was sent just a couple days before asking if I wanted to use the card on file. Although I stated in two previous emails to be sure to do so. 

Im now being told I will owe them $ XXXX and going through the same thing. Ive done everything on my end. My credit that I have been working hard to build up has dropped back down, and although I am aware I owe the money I borrowed, at this point that is all I am willingly to pay as I feel like this is not only harassment, but unnecessary stress and unethical conduct. 

I have documents including emails and text messages and I receive daily phone calls from them, even though I have already stated I would only communicate through written communication due to everything that has occurred thus far. I have been more than fair in trying to work to get this paid but now Im honestly scared of facing legal repercussions, which could end up costing me my job. 

Can you please help me? 
I would greatly appreciate it. 
Once I am able to speak to someone who can handle this I will send all documents as I dont want to overflood the system at this time. 

Thank you so much for your help and time. I really appreciate you and your support.

XXXX, the escaltions rep, emailed me saying they refunded the money back to me. I emailed him right back letting him know that he refunded the money to the SCAMMER 'S CARD. Him or anyone else from this company has reached back out to me to resolve this error. I even called for a supervisor and the rep stated the supervisor would give me a call back, 3 days later, no call back.

03/11/23,"Payday loan, title loan, or personal loan",Installment loan,Incorrect information on your report,Account information incorrect,"I was recently denied credit expressly because a loan account on my credit report is listed as an UNSECURED loan. 

The loan in in question is by all definitions, a secured loan. This was an installment loan I obtained from GoodLeap for HVAC system and plumbing repairs. The loan agreement explicitly describes this loan as secured, and details the collateral used as security. Additionally, the creditor filed a UCC-1 Financing statement declaring their security interest in the property. 

The TILA disclosure on my loan agreement clearly describes the security. 
Section 5 of my loan agreement reads "" GRANT OF SECURITY INTEREST IN COLLATERAL. To secure this loan ... '' and then goes on to describe the property used as collateral securing the loan.

Section 8 of my loan agreement REMEDIES, paragraph a ( 3 ) describes "" Foreclose on the Collateral ''.

Section 9 states that upon termination of the agreement, "" our security interest in the Collateral will terminate ''. 

I called GoodLeap to ask that the erroneous reporting as an unsecured account to the credit bureau be corrected to accurately reflect that the loan is secured. Over the course of nearly two hours I was told by 4 representatives that my loan is an UNsecured loan, and that they would not report anything different to the credit bureau ( s ). 

The word "" Collateral '' appears in my loan agreement exactly 31 times. The word "" security '' appears 12 times. The word "" unsecured '' appears XXXX times. 

When confronted with the language in my loan agreement, the last representative I spoke with agreed that the loan agreement describes collateral that is used to secure the loan, and also agreed that the UCC-1 filing declares GoodLeap 's security interest in the property. However, they still asserted that it is an unsecured loan and that they would take no action to correct how this loan is being reported. 

Unsecured debt is weighted differently than secured debt in credit decisioning, and this debt being classified as unsecured has negatively impacted my ability to obtain credit with other creditors, that I otherwise would have qualified for.",Company believes the complaint is the result of a misunderstanding,"Paramount GR Holdings, LLC",CO,80906,None,Consent provided,Web,03/11/23,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,6674707

The product in question is marketed as a loan, but in reality, it is not a loan at all. Instead, it is a purchase of future revenue from the borrower 's business earnings. This deceptive marketing practice is both illegal and unethical, and it puts vulnerable borrowers at risk.

Giggle Finance 's website repeatedly markets the product as a loan, even though the contract explicitly rejects the notion that it is a loan. This is a clear case of false advertising, as it misleads potential borrowers into thinking they are getting a loan when they are not. The website also fraudulently promises that borrowers ( who are actually "" sellers '' of their future revenue ) have "" extreme '' flexibility with repayments and can repay their "" loans '' at their own pace. However, the fine print in the contract requires them to pay a required amount weekly, which is far from flexible. 

This deceptive marketing practice puts vulnerable borrowers at risk of financial ruin. Many people who take out loans are already struggling financially, and they may not fully understand the terms and conditions of the loan they are taking out. By misrepresenting the product as a loan, Giggle Finance is taking advantage of these vulnerable borrowers and putting them in a worse financial situation. 

Therefore, I urge the CFPB to investigate Giggle Finance 's marketing practices and take appropriate action against the company. This kind of misleading and deceptive marketing is both illegal and unethical, and it should not be tolerated.

Thank you XXXX XXXX XXXX Klarna : Hello XXXX, I absolutely understand your concern regarding your payment for XXXX for your finance account. The reason your minimum balance is showing as this {$270.00} is because your minimum due this month was initially {$300.00}. Then the {$25.00} late fee was removed, bringing it to that {$270.00} you are seeing. I can confirm that I have reduced your minimum payment for the month of XXXX down to {$130.00}. This was a manual adjustment so you will not see this reflected on your statement or your account page because that information is updated once a month when the statement is generated. You will not get a late fee for making the minimum payment of {$130.00} for this month On XXXX, XX/XX/2023, XXXX XXXX, Klarna Dispute Resolutions XXXX wrote : Hello XXXX, Yes I do see where you had made your previous payments on the 2nd and they had counted toward your statement balance. I do apologize for this bug on our end. 

You will still owe the {$130.00} for the month of XXXX. Your statement balance says your minimum payment due is {$300.00}, but we have since removed the {$25.00} late fee and I reduced the monthly minimum payment by {$130.00}. So with those deductions your minimum due this month will be back to the original {$130.00}. I hope that clarifies it for you! 

Have a great day, XXXX XXXX me : I paid this bill on XX/XX/XXXX Thank you. Do I owe anything for the month of XXXX? 

In the past, I have been paying on this account on the same day for many months without a problem. I have made my payments as soon as I can. In the future, I will wait a day or 2 to make my payment Your app states the minimum payment is over {$270.00}. If I pay only XXXX I will be charged a late fee after XX/XX/XXXX. You did not correct the problem. I really want to get this settled. I am tired of sending you messages. I have contacted Klarna no less than 5 times on this one issue. 

I WANT TO PAY ONLY WHAT I OWE FOR XXXX. 

I want to get this done. Please call me so this can be settled without a late payment on XX/XX/XXXX. 

On XX/XX/2023, I am getting nowhere with you. THE MINIMUM payment on your app is {$270.00}. I CAN NOT PAY {$130.00} because it is less than {$270.00} and there is NO WAY to change it to {$130.00}. AND your telephone representatives can not take a payment over the phone. 

So THERE IS NO WAY FOR ME TO MAKE THIS PAYMENT. 
THEREFORE, I AM NOT PAYING MY XXXX PAYMENT UNTIL THERE IS A WAY TO PAY {$130.00}. 
I have yet to find a way to make this payment. Therefore, no payment will XXXX made UNTIL YOU HELP ME MAKE THIS PAYMENT.

01/19/23,"Payday loan, title loan, or personal loan",Installment loan,Charged fees or interest you didn't expect,None,"Multiple complaints : Loan documents incredibly difficult to get after initial signing -- I have emailed and called to get a copy of the loan documents that I signed. Documents not available upon secure login to website. MoneyTree requires I go to a physical store to receive documents. However, they use online and digital forms to get signatures and initiate the loan, so making someone drive an hour to then wait another hour just to get a copy is intentionally obstructionist. They certainly allow someone to log in and redo the loan and, at that time, if you're willing to pay for a new loan, they'll show you the documents. 

Access to any form of ledger or accounting data is missing and can not be accessed. I have called, emailed, and otherwise asked for an accurate statement. They indicate they can not provide this either. Again, this information is available upon initiating the loan or paying to change the loan, but otherwise you can not see any of the information related to the loan. 

Inaccurate receipt provided. I made a payment ahead of schedule and then paid an additional amount ( {$200.00} ). The receipt provided doesn't add up mathematically and can not account for {$75.00}. When I inquire, they indicate, only verbally and will not do so in email exchanges, that this amount is for the loan origination fee. Okay, then why not put that in the receipt? Then I ask about the amount going to principal and they similarly will only answer over a call and convolute things. They use "" daily fee '' and "" interest '' interchangeably. But cite them in different ways when talking about how they are calculated. The daily fee on the contract is the exact same each day, so the calculations for interest can not be easily explained. I asked for a simple written schedule accurately reflecting payments, additional amounts, and how that impacts the terms. They won't/ca n't provide this. 

When I ask about why the daily fee, which is also the interest, is more than the original loan agreement, they indicate that the daily fee comes out first, and a pre -- payment then means they will first take out the interest ( daily fee ) and apply the rest to the principal. When I point out that the second payment includes the daily fee they took out and thus the new payment should not include the same daily fees, they indicate that it doesn't, but that the payment doesn't change. So, I inquire how that impacts the principal and if more goes toward the principal for subsequent payments, because the daily fees have been paid in advance at that point, and they can't answer me. 

I went into a physical location and sat for a couple of hours asking them to help. They tried, and the result was that they could not explain the way the fees were taken out or how that wasn't reflected in subsequent payments and the daily fees which were not scheduled to be paid for 2 more weeks, but which they took out first so that the amount didn't go to the principal. All of this MIGHT add up, but nobody can explain it and they absolutely refuse to put anything in writing or on a receipt. The fact they can't/wo n't provide a written copy with accurate accounting and a statement that reflects the new schedule, if changed, makes the loan completely blind and irreconcilable to the consumer and any accounting. They seem to be unbound in obscuring this information.

Unable to get a statement I can hand to an accountant and a reflection of accurate interest for the IRS. I need to be able to show the interest paid on the loan, because it was used for business reasons, and thus the interest paid is a loss per the IRS and accounting. But I can not get anything that shows amounts that are accurate or which add up. Even a simple receipt for my payment which was made with an extra amount doesn't add up correctly.",None,Money Tree Lending,ID,83702,None,Consent provided,Web,01/19/23,Untimely response,No,N/A,6458368

Waited until XX/XX/XXXX to call back about the loan status and was told the check was cashed and money went to someone else account. Was asked to open a recovery claim with XXXX XXXX ( my bank where the fund should go to ). Based on Discover response, due to their incompetent practice, the claim had not started until XX/XX/XXXX. 
On XX/XX/2022, I received an email from XXXX XXXXXXXX, my bank, stating that the fund had been credited back to XXXX XXXX, a third party company Discover used to issue check for the fund. 
Then waited and waited forever without hearing anything from Discover until I filed the 2nd complaint.

Then conference call with XXXX XXXXXXXX took place on XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX  XXXX confirmed they had refunded the money and would provide the trace ID, and they did on XX/XX/XXXX I called Discover on XX/XX/XXXX and provided Trace ID for the refunded fund, I was asked to provide rounting number and account number and was promised that money would be disbursed back to my bank account in the next several days.

So basically, Discover doesn't know what they're doing. When I was asked to provide proof of refunded money, I did. But what they did to help me for this matter? Nothing, every single time I called, Discover lied and lied, and each different representative provided me different answer. How so? Also, the Chief executive phone number on the response letter is useless, never able to reach that person, so why bother to provide customer your number when you know you will avoid their call? 
So my question is if I do not keep pressing and pressing, would Discover just let this problem slide and take my payment every single month because they've been showing no effort to actually solve it. They said because the check had been cashed so I had to pay, fine, now XXXX XXXX returned the money, trace ID was also provided, what will be Discover next excuse?

03/04/23,"Payday loan, title loan, or personal loan",Personal line of credit,Charged fees or interest you didn't expect,None,"I am writing to report a bait-and-switch complaint against EnerBank USA. Last fall, I had my pitched roof replaced by XXXX, and they referred me to EnerBank USA for a no-payment, no-interest loan to underwrite the home improvement project. I used a no-payment, no-interest loan to pay for window replacements by XXXX so I am very familiar with how these loans work. There is a period ( in this case one year ) during which payments are not required and the loan does not accrue interest. As long as the balance is paid in full before the end of the promotional period, you pay no interest. 
My XXXX payment, XXXX interest period with EnerBank USA expires XXXX XXXX, XXXX. 
Even though payments were not required, I made two payments of {$940.00}. My XXXX XXXX, XXXX, XXXX XXXX, XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX statements from EnerBank USA shows these payments and labels them overpayment credit adjustment. These statements correctly show my regular monthly payment as XXXX because I am still in the XXXX payment, XXXX interest period of this home improvement loan. 

On XXXX XXXX, XXXX, I received yet another statement and it showed a {$940.00} postpayment reversal on XXXX XXXX ; an advance of {$10000.00} on XXXX XXXX, a {$940.00} post payment on XXXX XXXX and a second a {$940.00} post payment on XXXX XXXX. For the first time, the statement required a monthly payment of {$200.00}. 

I called EnerBank USA to complain, and they said these were the terms I signed in XX/XX/XXXX when the loan began. These are not the terms I signed. I agreed to a XXXX payment, XXXX interest period with EnerBank USA for a loan I will pay off in full before this promotional period expires on XXXX XXXX, XXXX. 

My second complaint relates to how EnerBank is now crediting my payments. My statement dated XXXX XXXX, XXXX shows my {$200.00} payment, but {$91.00} of it is applied toward interest. My XXXX payment, XXXX interest period with EnerBank USA XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX. This is significant because after that date, this loan is subject to 19.99 % interest. My statement dated XXXX XXXX, XXXX shows and overpayment credit adjustment of {$2800.00} ; that entire amount was deducted from my principal balance. My XXXX XXXX XXXX monthly payment, however, is marked a post payment and {$140.00} of the {$210.00} payment was applied toward interest. My XXXX payment, XXXX interest period with EnerBank USA expires XXXX XXXX, XXXX. My most recent statement, dated XXXX XXXX, XXXX shows my XXXX XXXX, XXXX monthly payment as a post payment and {$110.00} of the {$210.00} payment was applied toward interest. My XXXX payment, XXXX interest period with EnerBank USA XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX. 

I believe EnerBank switched me to a different loan product without my knowledge or consent. I am fortunate to have accrued roughly XXXX XXXX in equity in my home. There is ZERO chance I would knowingly sign up for a predatory home improvement loan at 20 % interest when I could have just as easily gotten a home equity loan for a single digit interest rate.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,REGIONS FINANCIAL CORPORATION,MD,212XX,None,Consent provided,Web,03/04/23,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,6647523

04/07/23,"Payday loan, title loan, or personal loan",Installment loan,Problem when making payments,None,"I opened a personal installment loan with Citibank in XXXX. It was set to autodraft monthly from the same account to which loan proceeds were deposited. 

In late XXXX and early XXXX, my checking account ending in XXXX at XXXX XXXX was compromised and debits totaling around {$20000.00} were made. XXXX XXXX immediately closed the account and removed the remaining funds and transferred them to XXXX of my other accounts at the same credit union. I was told certain recurring charges would still be allowed on a case-by-case basis and the funds would automatically transfer from my account ending in XXXX. 

In early XXXX, I noticed the Citibank autodraft had not come through. I tried to change the account information online but the system dead-ended in an error every time I tried. Changing the account information ( payment account information ) on the exact same website inside the exact same account for my Citi credit card took seconds, yet the personal loan resulted in a frustrating error time and time again. 

I called Citi on the loan servicing phone number XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX PM ET. The call lasted 13 minutes and 21 seconds. I notified the representative that I could not change my payment account online. She indicated that this was an easy fix. She took the new information for the account ending in XXXX, had me repeat it, ask me pertinent questions about the name and address on the account. While it took a long time, the call was ended thinking Citi would take the payment based on the new information provided. 

The payment was attempted to be deducted from the account ending in XXXX, the account that was closed. I specifically advised the representative that this account was closed, and it should not be used. She still processed the payment anyway without notifying me of what she was actually about to do. The payment amount was to be {$580.00} and a late fee. I did not protest the late fee because this was technically my fault, but I attempted to correct the problem way before the 30 day late period would kick in. At that point, it was 25 days late. More than enough time to satisfy the account and get back to regular payments. 

In early XXXX, I receive a dump of mailings from Citi. XXXX service is slower than usual and has been published by several government and news agencies. It is not a secret. 

One such mailing from Citi is from their "" Research Department '' asking me to mail a voided check for the account ending in XXXX. Not only is this ridiculous in the year XXXX, this could have also been sent via email or by a simple phone call. At this point, I did not understand why it was so difficult to pay Citibank. One would have thought that making payments would be an extremely straightforward process because banks universally make making payments extremely easy. 

Another mailing is notifying me that my account is severely past due. 

I start to call Citi on the same phone number as I did in early XXXX, XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX, I called this number five ( 5 ) times : XXXX PM ET XXXX PM ET XXXX PM ET XXXX PM ET XXXX PM ET On XX/XX/XXXX, I called this number again : XXXX PM ET XXXX PM ET On XX/XX/XXXX, I called this number again : XXXX PM ET XXXX PM ET Also, on XX/XX/XXXX, I called several other numbers to try and resolve this, including XXXX : XXXX PM XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX The original number, printed on all correspondence and Citi 's own mailings, XXXX would send me to their mortgage department. The mortgage department had no idea what was happening and would immediately transfer me to Citi 's checking, savings and debit card call center. I would ask to be transferred to a live agent in the personal loan department, but nobody seemed to know what to do. 

I finally called multiple times and got a representative at a banking center in The United States who told me that almost all of the call center employees at XXXX ( Work from Home ) in The XXXX. Also, the phone system is messed up when an account is held by the collections department and the problem has persisted for a long time. The banking center employee got a live representative in collections to help me. The collections department representative took payment information from me. I gave the account information ending in XXXX. This time, the representative told me what was going on. She said the system was saying it was invalid information and the account was not valid. She then explained that there was nothing else she could do and I'd have to wait to get a letter in the mail explaining what to do. Basically, I was going to have to wait two weeks for another mailing from Citi 's XXXX XXXX asking for a voided check. I do not write checks and have never ordered checks on this account. Again, it is XXXX! 

I pushed the representative to not abruptly end the call ( which Citi representatives enjoy doing either by mysteriously losing the call or transferring to the incorrect department ). As friendly as these representatives are based in The XXXX, they run on a script and anything that deviates from that script essentially freezes them and they have no idea what to do. 

I ask the representative to take my XXXX XXXX savings account information as payment for this past due account. It mysteriously works and I'm told the draft will be for {$580.00}. I confirm the amount and she confirms the pertinent information on the savings account. This call took place on XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX PM ET and lasted 27 minutes and 17 seconds. The new XXXX XXXX payment account ends in XXXX. 

After resolving this issue for the second time, I then begin to try and reach a department that handles credit bureau disputes or customer service. Not a single representative knows what I am talking about. Again, as the representatives are based in The XXXX, they are unaware of how the credit bureau and rating system works in this country. To them, a "" 30 days late mark '' means nothing to them and they're extremely unhelpful because it seems their main concern is ending the call as quickly as possible either by ( again ) mysteriously losing the call or transferring to an incorrect department. The best one is when they transfer me to an internal line that only asks for an extension number and nothing else. I was transferred to this line numerous times over the past month. Later on, one representative transferred me directly to XXXX, another transferred me directly to XXXX. When I say it is beyond frustrating to deal with Citibank and their current customer service structure, I wholeheartedly mean it.

Despite my attempts to resolve these issues directly with Zip, I have not received a satisfactory resolution, which has led me to escalate the matter to your esteemed organization. 

On XX/XX/21, I reached out to Zip 's support team regarding an account hold triggered by signing out of my previously logged-in devices and re-signing in ( XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  ) on the same day. I requested immediate removal of the hold, as it was preventing me from creating new virtual cards or making purchases using Zip. Although the hold was temporarily lifted after the 48-hour period, I encountered the same error message when trying to create another virtual card for a different purchase. This recurring issue has happened more than 15 times since I joined Zip earlier this year.

Zip 's support team has assured me on multiple occasions that this issue would not persist in the future once the temporary hold is automatically removed. However, the problem continues to recur without any just cause. 

Additionally, I would like to bring to your attention the unethical practices exhibited by Zip 's support team. They have repeatedly provided false promises, assuring me that I need not worry about the issue recurring in the future. This lack of accountability and failure to deliver a lasting resolution not only causes inconvenience but also undermines the trust I have placed in the reliability of Zip 's services. 

In light of these ongoing account hold issues and unethical practices, I kindly request your intervention in this matter. I seek the following actions to be taken by Zip ( XXXX ) : 1. Immediate removal of the account hold that is unjustly preventing me from creating virtual cards and making purchases. 
2. Implementation of effective measures to prevent the recurrence of such account holds in the future, ensuring a seamless and uninterrupted user experience.

3. Increased spending power limit to compensate for the inconvenience caused by these ongoing issues and to provide a more satisfactory user experience. 

If Zip ( XXXX ) fails to address these concerns in a prompt and effective manner, I kindly request your assistance in investigating this matter further and taking appropriate action to rectify the situation. I believe that the intervention of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is necessary to ensure fair and ethical practices within the industry and to protect consumers from such recurring issues. 

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I trust in the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau 's commitment to upholding consumer rights and fostering a fair marketplace. I look forward to your feedback and a resolution to this complaint.

The person on the phone asked if I wanted to roll my car loans into the loan. After a couple calls that day, I agreed I specifically asked if the interest rate would be better or at least the same. The person on the other end of the phone said would be about a percent lower than what I currently had. The current rate was about 17 % so the new loan shouldve been about 16 %. Which is a pretty high because my husband I have credit scores over XXXX. I was also never informed there would be an origination fee. I did receive the loan documents but because I was told the interest-rate would be lower and there was no mention of the origination fee. I signed the documents. 

Unfortunately, I didnt realize until one day passed the day you could stop the loan, that they charged me {$1800.00} origination fee, as I got to looking further not only did the person lie to me about the interest rate in lower. The interest rate is 20 % which is 3 % higher than what I had. I wouldve never agreed to these terms. 

I started calling XXXX XXXX in speaking with representatives on XX/XX/2023. The represent told me shell follow complaint for me and also asked that they listen to the call I had with their rep on XX/XX/2023 so they could see he never mentioned in the origination fee. The rep agreed to put that in the complaint. 

On XX/XX/2023 I believe I realized that the interest rate on my loan is not 16 % like the rep told me on XX/XX/2023. The interest rate is close to 21 %.. I called back XXXX XXXX that day spoke to a representative, explained that the rep called me on XX/XX/2023. Tell me the interest rate would be about a percent lower than what I currently had which at that time, My interest rate with 17 % They said they would update the complaint. I again asked for them to listen to the calls on XX/XX/2023. I was told it would be sent to a team leader supervisor. 

I think a couple days later I spoke to a supervisor who did confirm she listened to the call from XX/XX/2023 she confirmed that that rep did not tell me about an origination fee and did state my interest rate would be about a percent lower than what I currently had and at that time my interest rate was 17 %. 

She agreed to let her supervisors know Ive had multiple contacts with her since, I sincerely feel she has tried her best to get upper management to look at this case. But as of XX/XX/2023 no resolution my interest rate is still 20 % which is ridiculous.

Such a high interest rate is not only unethical but also exploitative. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, at approximately XXXX XXXX, the lender extended these terms to me. In response, I promptly sent them a request to cancel my loan at XXXX XXXX  on the same date. As per their agreement terms, my loan should be canceled with no penalties since it has not been funded as of the time of my cancellation request. 

I am filing this complaint with the CFPB to raise awareness of this lender 's predatory practices and to seek assistance in addressing the issue. I also request that the CFPB ensure the loan is canceled without any penalties, as specified in the lender 's agreement. It is crucial to protect other consumers from falling victim to such outrageous terms.

04/19/23,"Payday loan, title loan, or personal loan",Personal line of credit,Charged fees or interest you didn't expect,None,"Hello, I am writing to you regarding a trap Ive fallen into with a loan from Citizens Bank that should have been closed but wasnt. 

For some reason that is currently escaping me, I participate in the XXXX XXXX XXXX program. Through this plan, I receive a new phone every XXXX and start a new two-year loan with Citizens Bank to pay for the device. In exchange for returning my old phone, XXXX pays off the remainder of its associated loan and instructs Citizens One to close the account. 

This objectively terrible, financially-asinine program, allows me to funnel a lot of cash and a little bit of my soul each month to XXXX XXXX like the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX, in exchange for their newest and shiniest of their shiny new toys. 

Sure its expensive and stupid, but its also easy, and there is certainly utility in *easy* these days. But wait! Theres more : On XX/XX/XXXX, while reviewing expenses in preparation to file my XXXX tax returns, I noticed 10 double-charges to my credit card for my XXXX loan over the course of XXXX, and two more in XXXX for a total of 12 double-charges of {$69.00} each, totaling of {$900.00}. 

I then pored through 18 months of email notifications, including a few from XXXX Id never read, claiming theyd never received my trade-in phone back. I collected those emails, along with my proof of shipment in XXXX, CA and proof of delivery to XXXX in XXXX XXXX, CA, well within the limits of my contractual obligation. 

To rectify this documented, undeniable mistake, I have spent countless hours communicating on the phone and electronically with Citizens One ( the bank ), XXXX ( the seller ), and XXXX ( the credit card ), to no avail, and now you, the XXXX. Both XXXX and Citizens One told me to take the issue up with my credit card, and XXXX told me they cant do anything because the transactions all happened more than 90 days ago. 

XXXX at Citizens One tried to be helpful, but was unable to find my old loan in her system on a Sunday and suggested I call back during business hours when thered be a supervisor to whom she could escalate the issue. 

When I called and spoke with XXXX at Citizens Bank on Monday, XX/XX/XXXX, he called XXXX at XXXX who told us that the order was archived and she couldnt retrieve it, but could confirm at least that the phone HAD been returned. 

It seemed like we were on the verge of a solution when we were disconnected. But I didnt have a direct way to contact either of them, and neither bothered to call me back. XXXX didnt even leave any notes in my account, a frustrated XXXX said when I randomly got her on the phone again a second time. 

After a brief sanity break, I called XXXX once again on XX/XX/XXXX and spoke with probably-a-bot XXXX, who set up a callback with the department that could help me for XXXX. My phone rang at XXXX and I answered, pressed 1 to indicate I was ready to talk to a human, and was promptly disconnected, never to be called again. 

The last time I spoke with Citizens Bank was XXXX week ago, XX/XX/XXXX. I called and got XXXX on the phone a third time, and she quickly put me in touch with XXXX  , a manager who ostensibly had the power to and access to actually help me. 

XXXX asked if she could put me on hold and call XXXX and I said yes on the condition that, were we to be disconnected, she would actually call me back. XXXX at XXXX said she didnt have access to order XXXX because it was more than 90 days old. When I asked her to escalate the problem to a supervisor and after putting XXXX and me on hold for several minutes, she claimed her supervisor also couldnt help. XXXX refused to even verbally acknowledge that the phone had been returned, even though XXXX had been able to confirm that days earlier. 

At that point, XXXX actually gave me an email address to which I could send my documentation. I emailed all my docs to XXXX. After a few hours, they evidently didnt come through, and XXXX called me back to confirm that Id actually sent them. I then emailed the docs two more times from two different email accounts until XXXX confirmed on the phone theyd been received. 

She said she would attached them to my record so it could be resolved. That was a week ago, and I havent heard from them since. 

That this money is owed back to me is indisputable, I simply need help pushing back on three terrible companies with a clear a financial interest in NOT helping me fix their stupid mistakes.

I have always paid on time. This loan was meant to help improve my credit rating. 

A few months ago, I opted to disable automatic debits for MoneyLion, so I could make those payments manually. I did so for 3 payments ( {$48.00} each ), over a period of 1.5 months. On the fourth, I decided to pay the remaining balance on the loan - approximately {$190.00} - directly, on XX/XX/XXXX. As with any ACH transfer, I expected it to take about a week. It has now been 2.5 weeks, and they have not taken the payment. 

I have attempted to reach out to them via numerous methods : CSR on their app, phone CSR, email CSR, all of which have given me conflicting answers about why they aren't taking this payment, when an explanation was even offered. I have been told in turns, that they couldn't receive the payment because it was "" still pending for 3-5 business days '' ( it is Business Day 12, as of this writing ) ; another excuse was that my disabling of automatic payments prevented them from initiating the payment ( which wasn't a problem on the three prior payments ) ; another excuse was that the account didn't have sufficient funds ( both provably untrue, AND the bank insists they have not received any ACH transfer requests from MoneyLion, failed or otherwise ). 

The one thing none of them has said, is that they will take my money. Not one of them. I can only assume they don't want me to pay them anymore. If it weren't for them submitting a non-payment report to credit reporting agencies for their own XXXXXXXX, I wouldn't be half as incensed about this. 

I can not believe this is even an issue. What kind of loan company doesn't take payments? It's usually difficult to get these places to refund or discount something, but they're usually pretty eager to receive money.

I was told if I paid in full by XX/XX/XXXX, there would be no interest or fees. I proceeded based on that promise. 

XX/XX/XXXX : I paid the account in full for {$4100.00} & received a confirmation of the payment via email. 

XX/XX/XXXX : I received a text that my payment was late, a {$30.00} fee was assessed. Confused, I logged in online to discover my payment was rejected. First I checked with my bank ( XXXX ), they said none of my payments had been returned & confirmed adequate funds available to cover the expense. Second, I used the chat feature to find out what was wrong ( chat history attached ). First they said the payment didn't go through. Then it was fraud. They couldn't help via chat & gave me a number to call to speak with a specialist. I called, XXXX, twice & got no answer & left a message. 

XX/XX/XXXX : I received an email. Basically saying they suspected fraud ( on a bill I'm trying to pay mind you ). I needed to wait 10 days for a suspension to be removed ( meaning I can't pay the bill ). 

XX/XX/XXXX : I received another statement showing additional fees. I called again & was given the run around about 10 days to wait. 

XX/XX/XXXX : I called again, insisted on speaking with supervisors. I was "" disconnected '' twice, told the suspension would be removed, I could pay partial but not all, on & on, finally told a supervisor would call me back. I did try making the partial payment & was still given an error message as the suspension is still active, even after verification of my identity & ability to us the debit card on the same account. 

I have NEVER once received a call back I was NEVER notified of suspected fraud causing issues with my payment. 

If they can text & email every notification, then why is it they never notified me of the rejected payment? THEY are the ones who are fraudulent & predatory by intentionally creating barriers to payment in order to charge bogus fees. 

I'm happy to pay my legitimate balance owed of {$4100.00}. 
I'm asking to do so with all fees & interest removed ( {$130.00} now ) & any negative credit reporting is expunged. No one at the company seems to be able to speak with me to resolve this as I keep getting bounced around or told to wait ( for what Im still not sure as Ive provided proof of my identity ).

Despite my repeated attempts to rectify the situation, Grain has failed to address the errors and has not taken appropriate action to correct my credit report. 

The issues I have encountered with Grain began when their mobile application prevented me from logging in, leading to the reporting of late payments. Despite my persistent efforts to contact Grain and resolve the matter, I was unable to reach anyone for assistance. It took over four months before I was provided with a link to make a payment, only to discover that my XXXX debit card was not accepted. Consequently, I had to rely on my daughter to make the payment for the amount Grain claimed I owed. 

To my dismay, Grain unexpectedly refunded the payment made by my daughter, stating it was an error on their part. I have sent multiple letters to dispute the late marks on my credit, but each time Grain has verified them without making any corrections to their errors. I have included the email correspondence between myself and Grain as evidence, which clearly demonstrates the prolonged response times and Grain 's failure to address the inaccuracies in their reporting. 

I firmly believe that Grain 's inaccurate reporting and their subsequent failure to rectify the situation have significantly impacted my credit history.

05/21/23,"Payday loan, title loan, or personal loan",Installment loan,Charged fees or interest you didn't expect,None,"I have evidence Lightstream/Truist Financial Corporation ( `` Creditor '' ) received payment-in-full from the XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX ( `` Principals '' ) in the form of a promissory note which is the enclosed Contract, a negotiable instrument according to UCC 3-104 and can be accepted as a deposit to the Creditors bank account in exchange for credits according to 12 USC 1813 ( l ). Also, since the Contract included a promise to pay the Finance Charge, the Creditor has also already received the Finance Charge in full in the form of credits exchanged for the promissory note. This is only possible because the promissory note is evidence of debt and is secured by direct obligations of the United States according to 12 USC 347c. The Creditor used the promissory note to receive credits from the US Treasury in the same way banks receive a US dollar bill, which is also evidence of debt, in exchange for credits to a bank account. 

Although the Creditor has already received payment-in-full from the Principals through the promissory note, the Creditor willfully and knowingly created false and misleading invoices mailed to the Principals in order to receive additional payments from the Principals. 15 USC 1605 clearly states the Finance Charge is the sum of all charges in connection with a consumer credit transaction. Since the Creditor created charges in addition to the Finance Charge they already received, this is a violation of 15 USC 1605 and the Creditor is subject to civil liability pursuant to 15 USC 1640 and criminal liability pursuant to 15 USC 1611.

In regard to the principal balance shown in Principals online access ( viewable document not provided because Creditor has not made one available ), it is presented to the Principals as a remaining amount owed by the Principals to the Creditor. The principal balance is actually a credit balance owed by the Creditor to the Principal. This is evident from the Creditor having to adhere to the Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ( GAAP ) pursuant to 12 USC 1831n ( a ) ( 2 ) ( A ) since they received the promissory note as an asset on their books. To legally offset the asset ( promissory note ) received from the Principals, the Creditor securitized the promissory note by creating a liability owed to the Principals in the form of a debt instrument/bond. Therefore, the principal balance belongs to the Principals. According to 15 USC 1666d, the Creditor should have credited the credit balance to the Principals account, refunded to the Principal upon the Principals request and made a good faith effort to refund the remaining credit balance to the Principal by cash, check, or money order. Since the Creditor did not act according to 15 USC 1666d, they instead fraudulently attempted to receive additional payments from the Principals. As a result, the economic effect of the Creditors actions is similar to counterfeiting, swindling and stealing from the Principals.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,TRUIST FINANCIAL CORPORATION,TX,77584,None,Consent provided,Web,05/21/23,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,7007517

Affirm sees that loan XXXX was processed on XX/XX/2023, for a purchase with the merchant, XXXX XXXX XXXX , in the amount of {$940.00}. This loan has terms of 15.09 % Annual Percentage Rate ( APR ) and 12 monthly payments of {$21.00} due on the 15th of each month. We first heard from you on XX/XX/2023, when you submitted an inquiry through our Help Center form. We replied to your request and asked for further details on XX/XX/2023, and you sent us some evidence the same day. You called and spoke to one of Affirms agents on XX/XX/2023, and explained that when you had made your purchase there was a 30-day money back guarantee and that you had canceled with the merchant within 2 days, but it was hard to get in direct contact with the merchant. We requested further details from both you and the merchant the same day and also opened an official merchant dispute. We received further evidence from you and the merchant also replied with evidence on the XXXX. Once we had evidence from the merchant and you, we were able to come to a resolution and closed the dispute in merchant favor on XX/XX/2023. At the time of the investigation the merchant had provided evidence to show the purchase was non-refundable and the merchant is working within their policies. You provided further evidence the same day of the dispute closure and called in to discuss your dissatisfaction. The agent escalated your merchant dispute case to be looked at again. We received more evidence from you again on XX/XX/2023. On XX/XX/2023, you received a secure message from Affirm stating that, the 30-day trial ended on XX/XX/2023. Your evidence stated that you reached out for the refund in XXXX. The item was not canceled within 30 days per their policy. The purchase is also nonrefundable. Since they are operating within their policy, we resolved the dispute in favor of the merchant. The initial decision stands, you remain responsible for this loan. Affirm apologies that we know this was incorrect information provided to you and the agent replied to you the same day, apologizing for their misinformation. They corrected their previous communication by stating the course was purchased on XX/XX/2023. This course is an information product. Self-paced courses, hybrid programs, and recorded webinars are non-refundable as you now have full access to the courses. The purchase is nonrefundable. Since the merchant is operating within their policy, we resolved the dispute in favor of the merchant. The initial decision stands, and you remain responsible for this loan. On XX/XX/2023, Affirm has requested that the appropriate team review the claim again specifically focusing on the 30 day money back guarantee. On XX/XX/2023 we had the opportunity to review everything again and reached out to you via secure message. We found that once again the purchase reflects it is non-refundable. Additionally, the merchant had requested that you send proof that the product did not work and this was not received on their end to be able to use the 30 day money back guarantee. Please note, Affirm manages the financing of your purchase, and all refunds are subject to the policies of the merchant. Until the merchant refunds your loan, you are still responsible for repayment.

05/05/23,"Payday loan, title loan, or personal loan",Installment loan,Charged fees or interest you didn't expect,None,"I was part of the XXXX XXXX XXXX for XXXX XXXX specifically with the full-stack engineering course on XX/XX/2022. I was offered the opportunity and was offered the chance to finance through Climb Credit. I had some initial difficulty applying on my own so I had my husband apply with me and was approved for the total of the class. Due to outside circumstances, I unfortunately had to withdraw early and was offered a partial refund from XXXX XXXX since I had been in the class for 12 days, which was understandable. 

The refund process was a nightmare and took approximately 6 months for it to reflect as having been processed, which to this day still shows that I owe the full {$15000.00} despite the refund being processed weeks ago according to XXXX XXXX. Now, on this I will not fault Climb as I think the error was on XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX end, however the refund was processed, according to XXXX XXXX, and as of me writing this I still reflect the full balanced owed, with a payment coming due in the coming weeks for that full balance. 

Where I begin this complaint is that the amount that was refunded seems to be vastly under what I actually paid out. I received a refund of {$9500.00} when I should have received a refund of {$11000.00}. It was explained to me by XXXX XXXX that this extra {$2300.00} or roughly 20 % of the value of the loan is a fee/tip/gratuity that Climb takes off the the top of the loan. Setting aside the fact that any financial product that takes 20 % of the value of the product as a tip is an extremely poorly designed financial product, that I normally would not have signed up for, I also noticed that I was unable to find this tip or anything mentioning this 80 % advance value loan in either agreement I signed with both XXXX XXXX or Climb Credit. I have uploaded both agreements and have gone through both.

I find the complainant to be incorrect in their response, and am requesting a re-investigation, based on the following statements made by TMX.

First, TMX stated the following, According to TitleMax records, XXXX XXXX entered a twenty-four ( 24 ) month Consumer Installment Loan Agreement, Promissory Note And Security Agreement ( the "" Agreement '' ) with TitleMax on XX/XX/XXXX, in the original principal amount of {$1000.00} ( the "" Loan '' ) and pledged her XXXX XXXX XXXX ( the "" Vehicle '' ) as collateral. Pursuant to the terms of the Agreement, XXXX XXXX was required to make twenty-three ( 23 ) monthly installment payments of {$170.00} beginning on XX/XX/XXXX ( "" Loan '' ), and one ( 1 ) final payment of {$170.00} on XX/XX/XXXX, to satisfy and discharge her obligations under the Agreement. XXXX XXXX exercised her right according to the Agreement, refinanced the Loan on seven ( 7 ) occasions, and added additional funds bringing the principal balance to {$3900.00} according to the Agreement signed on XX/XX/XXXX, by XXXX XXXX. 
This statement is hearsay and not valid as it provides no supporting documentation that validates this statement, and I am requesting they submit me with ALL the supporting documentation that validates this request. This is a predatory loan that is operating under Consumer Installment loans when in actuality it is a title loan and based on MO Title Loan Law and correspondence, I had with Missouri Attorney XXXX XXXX XXXX in regards to these types of predatory loans, Based on Missouri Rev 408.510 which and my contract which is attached this is a title loan registered as Missouri statue, XXXX. Licensure of consumer installment lenders -interest and fees allowed. -Notwithstanding any other law to the contrary, the phrase "" consumer installment loans '' means secured or unsecured loans of any amount and payable in not less than four substantially equal installments over a period of not less than one hundred twenty days. The phrase "" consumer installment lender '' means a person licensed to make consumer installment loans. A consumer installment lender shall be licensed in the same manner and upon the same terms as a lender making consumer credit loans. Such consumer installment lenders shall contract for and receive interest and fees in accordance with sections 408.100, 408.140, and 408.170. Consumer installment lenders shall be subject to the provisions of sections 408.551 to 408.562.

Furthermore, I am requesting a rei-investigation as TMX stated, The Company 's policy indicates that military borrowers, spouses, and dependents ( "" covered borrowers '' ) are not eligible for a loan. An automated or manual check of the MLA or SCRA website is required by the Company before any credit application can be completed and before any request to refinance an existing loan/pawn may be processed. Onboarding identifies covered borrowers through an automatic ping to the Department of Defense 's MLA database. Based off of this statement I am requesting the proof to this claim I would like to see the supporting documentation where they ping the Department of Defenses MLA database, as to where they did NOT find my information as I indicated. I submitted several pieces of documentation that verified my claim including and not limited to the things I discussed and proved to be true such as this being a predatory loan, loan churning, and not maintaining accurate records. 
Finally TMX stated, TitleMax agrees to stop the interest on XXXX XXXX account as of XX/XX/XXXX. Given the above investigation. They further explain they have done no wrongdoing, and yet claim they will stop the interest on the loan I find this comment to be an admission of guilt that this is a predatory loan because why else make such a libel statement if no wrongdoing was effective. 

In conclusion I am requesting the information outlined be provided to me as proof that the statements are correct, TMX has provided no supporting documentation re : these claims and I find the information to be hearsay as it has not been validated as truth. I am still requesting a Invoice that is Paid In Full and the return of my title, they list the Principal balance only at {$3900.00} when the total if {$3900.00} cant be paid is A little more than {$13000.00} and in total I borrowed {$3600.00} and TMX has received a little over {$5000.00} for the Amount borrowed and based on MO law for title loans this loan is deemed Paid In full. They have not provided the contract where it shows I said No ' to my MLA status my documentation shows no questions in relation to MLA status and my response being NO, I want proof of this also, and have attached my supporting documentation once again for reference. 
In closing I am requesting my title back and paid in full invoice for this loan is illegal and has already been Paid in full TMX is indicating in addition to already paying {$5000.00} or more that a principal balance of {$3900.00} is still due, which would be roughly {$8000.00} being paid for a vehicle not even valued at this amount, they are a scam and rip off, and I am currently working with my Mayor XXXX XXXX and Attorney General, XXXX XXXX to initiate legislation based on my experience with predatory lenders such as TMX, this entire response is hearsay of predatory lender because I have not seen any supporting documentation that makes their claims valid/true. 
I am again requesting that my title be returned to me and a Invoice that shows paid in full. 

Cordially, XXXX XXXX I have attached my previous request and TMX response to be thoroughly reviewed and MO state laws re : title loans and installment loans, as TMX is abusing consumer installment loan which they are licensed under and abiding by those rules when these loans are title loans and they are not following the the law.",None,TMX Finance LLC,MO,64138,None,Consent provided,Web,06/08/23,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,7089324

My concern is that Affirm has reported delinquent payments on my account to credit reporting agencies, despite assurances from Affirm representatives that this would not happen. I believe that Affirms actions may be in violation of federal consumer financial laws. 

When I first opened my Affirm account to finance my purchase through XXXX, I was specifically told that this account would not be reported to any credit bureaus and would not affect my credit. However, in early XX/XX/2023, I received a notification from Affirm stating that my account was late and that it would be reported to credit bureaus. I immediately called Affirm and spoke to a supervisor who confirmed that this type of account would not affect my credit as it does not report to any credit bureaus. I also spoke to XXXX and XXXX who assured me that this account would not be reported to credit bureaus. Here are the case number from both calls that day ( Case # XXXX & case # XXXX ). 

I believe that Affirm 's actions may be in violation of the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) and other federal consumer financial laws that protect consumers from unfair, deceptive, or abusive practices in the financial marketplace. 


After 10 days, I received an email/message ( attached to this complaint ) from XXXX ( XXXX ID XXXX ) stating that the account in question ( XXXX ( XXXX ) ) does not include credit reporting at this time, and that all payments were made on time and no negative information was reported to XXXX. However, when I reviewed my credit account, I discovered that Affirm had reported my account as delinquent. 

When I called Affirm on XX/XX/2023 to request that they remove the delinquent reporting from my account, I was told that they have the right to report if they want and refused to remove the delinquent remarks. I spoke with XXXX and the case # XXXX. I believe that this behavior is unethical and goes against the assurances that were given to me by Affirm representatives.

The order, dated XX/XX/XXXX totaled {$500.00}. I have a copy of this order. 

I processed the order using Credit that I already had established with AFFIRM XXXX and set the purchase up to have monthly payments in the amount of {$48.00} deducted from the XXXX XXXX 's business checking account. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I was notified via text message to my personal mobile phone at ( XXXX ) XXXX that the first of the {$48.00} payments would be deducted on XX/XX/XXXX. 

As far as I could tell that {$48.00} payment was completed, because on XX/XX/XXXX, I received a follow-up text message thanking me for the XX/XX/XXXX payment. [ My assumption : the payment was completed without incident ]. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I was again notified via text message to my personal mobile phone at ( XXXX ) XXXX that the second of the {$48.00} payments would be deducted on XX/XX/XXXX. 

However on XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX pm, I received a text message this time, stating that "" We couldn't process your scheduled payment of {$48.00}. Please pay at XXXX '' I knew that this COULD NOT BE TRUE, BECAUSE AT NO TIME SINCE I MADE THIS PURCHASE, HAS MY CHECKING ACCOUNT BALANCE NOT EXCEEDED THE AMOUNT REQUIRED TO SATISFY THESE PAYMENTS. SO, later that day, I logged into my account using the link supplied. And I again re-authorized the {$48.00} payment using Account # XXXX. 

AFFIRM XXXX sent me a text message acknowledging the payment. But, in a couple of days, I received another text notification, stating that the {$48.00} payment was again overdue. By this time, I'm mad as XXXX, because I know there are adequate funds in the business checking to cover this {$48.00} payment, and I'm wondering why my payment keeps getting declined when I KNOW full well I am an authorized signer on the account, and I have provided the correct account number. 

This text message provided me with a code that I could text back to immediately re-authorize the payment, which I used re-authorizing the payment a third ( XXXX ) time only to be notified via text message AGAIN that the payment couldn't be processed. I was asked to update my payment method and again I was invited to navigate to the link supplied XXXX. 

After the third attempt to authorize this payment, I decided to call Affirm to try to determine why this payment was repeatedly being declined. And I was told that "" The Account Is Closed '' which we all know to be UNTRUE. 

I HASTEN TO MAKE CLEAR THAT IN THE BEGINNING OF THESE ISSUES WITH AFFIRM, I ERRONEOUSLY PLACED THE BLAME ON MY BANK WHERE WE HAVE OUR BUSINESS CHECKING ACCOUNT. HOWEVER, AFTER CONTACTING MY BANK IN WRITING, AND PROVIDING THEM WITH THE DOCUMENTATION OF THE ISSUE, THEY LOOKED INTO IT, AND CORRESPONDED BACK TO ME THAT THE PRE-AUTHORIZED AFFIRM PAYMENTS NEVER REACHED SOUTHERN STATES BANK. 

My business checking account has NEVER been closed in my recent memory, and therefore, I began to question why something of this nature could be repeatedly occurring. As a business owner-operator of many years, my personal credit is very important to me, because there are times when funds may not be readily available to take care of issues that arise, and therefore I depend on my creditworthiness, and my ability to get things done whether the funds are available or not. THUS, these repeated declined payments made me suspicious of my bank, where my checking account is held. 

As a means of illustrating and documenting the facts of my unpleasant encounters with my Affirm XXXX account, I have retained screen-shots of my numerous text messages, and emails received basically advising me of the payment issues. 

IN ADDITION TO THE PRESENT CONCERN ADDRESSED HEREIN PLEASE NOTE THAT .... 

THIS IS NOT THE FIRST TIME THAT these repeated declined payments have occurred where similar transactions were involved. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I ordered XXXX rear-outlet toilets for the public restrooms in our funeral home. This online order was placed with Signature Hardware. 

Together, the XXXX toilets cost {$580.00}. And again, I was approved for financing via AFFIRM credit. I agreed to XXXX payments in the neighborhood of {$52.00} per month. These monthly payments were to be made via automatic draft from the same Business Checking Account # XXXX. 

During that period of time, other than the first payment, XXXX XXXX Bank declined every single payment, up until XXXX or XXXX of that year, when I finally just GOT TIRED and switched the payment over to my personal checking account, and finished paying for the toilets without incident. 

MY QUESTION : Why should I have had to use my personal funds to pay for a business purchase, when the business checking account had adequate funds to cover each of these {$52.00} per month payments ; and the payments had been pre-authorized by me? 

AS A RESULT, I REALLY DEVELOPED ANGER TOWARD MY BANK, BUT I NOW BELIEVE THAT MY ANGER WAS MIS-DIRECTED. 

SO BECAUSE OF THE DECLINED PAYMENTS, I CONTINUED TO ERRONEOUSLY PLACE THE BLAME ON MY BANK, XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX, XXXX, FOR THESE DECLINED PAYMENTS. 

THIS situation became so frustrating for me, that on XX/XX/XXXX, I emailed AFFIRM, because I felt so BAD that they had extended me the privilege of making payments on this very important piece of my business operation, and I felt that I had floundered in upholding my agreement with them ; because of action that YOU took with respect to my business account AND DIDN'T BOTHER TO INVOLVE me in that decision. 

During this time ( when I was paying on the XXXX toilets ), I called XXXX XXXX Bank in XXXX, to inquire about these transactions. Though I can not recall specifically who I spoke to, I do remember that I was told that there was NO REASON why these payments should have been declined. Yet they continued to be declined. 

As proof of the numerous, multiple communications ; and the back-and-forth that I have had to engage in, to try to make this right, I have maintained copies of each of these documents. I will attach as many as I can. 

PLEASE NOTE that the letters I have written were addressed to my Bank : XXXX XXXX Bank, XXXX, XXXX However, through the process of corresponding with XXXX XXXX Bank, I now believe that AFFIRM is the origin of the problem, and NOT XXXX XXXX Bank ( as I had originally thought. I am uploading the letter, however, so that you can see the full explanation of the situation, which I directed to my bank, when actually I should have been directing them to AFFIRM. 

I now believe that the problem lies with AFFFIRM, and despite numerous efforts to call and speak to somebody who has the authority to correct this situation, I can't get anywhere, because I end up speaking to some foreign representative, whose XXXX is not good, and unable to effectively communicate with me. Furthermore, there is NO XXXX at their publicized phone number who can speak to a customer with any clarity or with any degree of competence. THIS, TOO HAS MADE MY SITUATION WORSE. 

ON XX/XX/XXXX, I fell and sustained a XXXX XXXX, and was immobile and incapacitated for months, and was unable to try to troubleshoot this situation for months, so as things now stand, the monthly amount has not been paid, and Affirm is sending me threatening texts and emails saying they basically can ruin my credit.

That means they want to play it safe but don't care what happens to my credit history. Unfortunately, when the above activities are piled up by certain businesses after multiple foul play, the trouble becomes a nightmare on my credit report.

I am writing to kindly request the removal of late payments from my accounts, specifically for the accounts with the following numbers : XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX. I understand that the late payments occurred during the challenging period of the COVID-19 pandemic and before the pandemic when I was faced with the unexpected circumstances of being laid off and searching for a career path. I am deeply grateful for the understanding and support that Navy Federal Credit Union has shown during this time. 

Firstly, I want to express my sincere appreciation for the opportunities you have provided me over the years as a valued member of your credit union. I have always been proud to be associated with Navy Federal, and your exceptional customer service has been a significant factor in my financial journey.

During the unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic, I faced financial hardships due to job loss and reduced income. As a result, I experienced difficulties in making timely payments on my accounts. However, I am delighted to inform you that both the loan accounts, with account numbers XXXX and XXXX, have been successfully paid off. The remaining account, XXXX, is also nearing its full settlement, and I expect to have it paid off shortly. 

I wish to emphasize that I have learned valuable lessons during these challenging times, which have greatly contributed to my personal growth and financial maturity. I have become more disciplined and responsible in managing my finances, and I am committed to ensuring that all future payments are made promptly. 

Considering my long-standing relationship with Navy Federal Credit Union , the successful pay-off of the aforementioned accounts, and the extenuating circumstances surrounding the late payments during the pandemic, I kindly request your consideration in removing the late payment records from my credit report. 

Removing these late payment entries from my credit profile would significantly improve my creditworthiness and strengthen my financial standing. With the newfound knowledge and maturity I have gained, I am determined to continue demonstrating a reliable payment history moving forward. 

I truly value the relationship I have with Navy Federal Credit Union, and I believe that this goodwill gesture would not only benefit my financial prospects but also reaffirm the trust and loyalty I hold towards the credit union.

I would be deeply grateful for your understanding and positive response to my request. If possible, I kindly ask that you provide a written confirmation of the late payment removal for my records. 

Thank you for taking the time to consider my request. Please feel free to contact me at XXXX or XXXX if any further information is required.

The original loan amount was {$1900.00} and I made total payments of {$1400.00}. During XXXX I assumed the care of my dying mother. I contacted Lift credit many times requesting assistance in stopping interest charges, paying off the principal, etc. at each contact point I was ignored and told it would continue to accrue interest and ultimately become a legal matter. This loan was requested during a very difficult time and I never anticipated such devastation as a result. My mother passed away in XX/XX/XXXX. Additionally my son was diagnosed with a XXXX XXXXXXXX and the medical expenses and debts have ballooned to over {$15000.00}. Despite sharing these challenges with Lift, they would not negotiate, provide a reasonable compromise, but instead threaten legal action and demonstrate no care in the devastation this predatory loan has now caused.

Lift filed a small claims case and without any options to defend myself, they received judgement of over {$8000.00} with a repayment of {$430.00} per month. I do not have the money to make payment without sacrificing the care of my son, servicing of my debt and maintaining monthly housing and utility expenses.

Regardless of credit standing, we offer significantly lower rates than payday lendersgiving a financial solution to those who need it most. And online installment loans to lift you higher. Their site is also flooded with misleading reviews and testimonials. At an interest of 382 % annually, the ability to service this loan should a borrower experience continued financial hardship, it quickly grows from a modest loan balance to 4 or 5 times the original loan. The end result is devastating to an average consumer. Lastly, during the collections process, the lender communicated via text and did not made a proper collection notification disclosure.

Shortly after that, I was transferred for work and began struggling with bills due to increased expenses. I made several attempts to work with this company but they refused to allow me to make smaller payments to catch up and they called me daily and often multiple times a day to threaten to sue me and take my assets if I didnt comply. I was forced into refinancing my loan in XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX, which resulted in a monthly payment increase of around {$440.00} and having to borrow additional money for the refinance to be approved. I was already struggling to make payments and my payment was greatly increased. This increased monthly payment also included the insurance that I have denied every time.

I contacted them today because I took out he line of credit for medical purposes and am currently undergoing treatments and have the medical documentation as evidence. I had no idea the interest was 338.75 % which is what I am now being told. I asked if I could stop the interest and would attempt to pay {$300.00} a month for XXXX months to pay the original amount plus the {$300.00}. I was told they could do nothing and would not work with me. Please help me resolve this. I contacted an attorney and was told let them take me to court because it would be thrown out in the State of Tennessee and he would represent me. My other option is to include it in a bankruptcy.

XXXX placed XX/XX/XXXX with Klarna- this is an order that was split into 6 monthly payments. Each amount typically totaling to {$41.00}, but things are bound to change due to Klarna 's price manipulations. But besides that, there has been an issue with this order, the quality of the item not being up to par nor meeting the standards of authenticity. I reported the issues to Klarna. They said get in contact with the merchant while the installment was supposed to be paused by Klarna back in late XXXX. Efforts have been futile with both sides so I'm in a dilemma with not having a satisfactory order. I've also been getting alerts on the app that the payment is due on XX/XX/XXXX. Nonstop the order is due, the order is due. Etc etc. On top of that- for this order.. they said on the app that I owed XXXX. Now the price of what they claim I owe for this order is at {$79.00}??

Nothing on One Main 's results on XXXX XXXX said that the loan was a secured loan. The button I clicked, in fact, said "" Take this offer ''. I clicked it after reviewing the terms of the offer. Nowhere did it say this was a secured loan, and in fact, other offering below the One Main offers were clear that they were secured loans.

Nothing to indicate that this was for a secured loan. I filled out some information for open an account with One Main and then they asked for my car insurance and car ownership documentation. Although there was still nothing from One Main to indicate that this was a secured loan, I was suspicious. I called One Main and waited on hold for 45 minutes. Their person- on a recorded line they said- told me that I was not approved for an unsecured loan, but for a secured loan. I asked if they had done a hard credit check. He said yes. I advised him I was making this complaint. 

My complaint is this : This practice is bait and switch. One Main offered me a loan, presented the interest rate, the term, and the monthly payments and made no mention of the "" secured '' nature of the loan- in fact never did until the male customer service person told me about it. Their acceptance button said "" take this offer ''.

I attempted to work out some sort of payment plan with them regarding my balance in XXXX well before the next payment was due and in over 5 calls nothing was offered as a way to negate being late. Fast forward to XX/XX/XXXX there was a conversation with XXXX regarding my account and finally DLC agreed to discuss a resolution. XXXX offered me over the phone a compromise of paying off the remaining principal balance with them waiving all interest, saving me roughly {$350.00} in interest. I accepted the offer and we agreed verbally I was to make THREE biweekly payments of roughly {$370.00}. Because I wasn't born last night and unfortunately lenders lie too often, I asked for this offer in writing. XXXX was hesitant to give that to me and stated she would have to "" ask her manager '' for it. 

Weird that I can not be the first person to experience this and her hesitation made me even more nervous that they wouldn't hold up their end of the bargain. I heard nothing from XXXX NOR received anything via mail highlighting the offer in writing as of XX/XX/XXXX. 

I received a report that Dollar Loan Center had recently reported my account LATE for the first time ever in mid XXXX .... meaning that AFTER we had agreed on a payment plan to PIF the account, they still reported me late to Bureaus? How can I be late when the first payment was not due yet??? 

I transmitted these concerns to XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX and she somehow couldn't comprehend what I was saying. She continued to state that "" the account is still overdue therefore those remarks it was reported late WILL STAY. '' Let me get this straight ... .. you offered me a PIF and we agreed on the plan .... you then reported me late on my account to the bureaus BEFORE my first payment was due??? How can you legally do that? 

You offering me a PIF of the principal negates the prior contract legally, therefore you can not enforce the prior contract "" whenever you want to. '' I advised XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX I didn't make the first payment on XX/XX/XXXX because I had not received anything in writing stating their promise of the deal. She stated that the remarks reported after our agreement BEFORE the first payment would stay regardless if I exercised my options or not. 

I hung up the phone and will continue to seek regulatory assistance. This can not be legal. You can not offer a new payment agreement overriding the previous contract, then backtrack at will and reinforce the original contract whenever you please. 

In addition to the main concern above, when this loan was initially taken out I was told that the "" Credit Line '' was in fact a "" credit line '' meaning it would report to bureaus as a credit line. Instead, their false advertising led to every time I reborrowed against my line, they would pay off the old one ( even though I didn't pay off the old one ) and reissue a new loan. Creating multiple loan tradelines on my CBR lowering and damaging my credit score by manipulating my average age of accounts. 

For example : Lets say you are approved for a credit line of {$1000.00} and take the full amount. You pay off {$400.00} and owe {$600.00}. You call and want to borrow the {$400.00} available on the credit line .... they instead tell the credit bureaus that you "" paid off the whole balance '' and "" borrowed a new {$1000.00}.

08/06/23,"Payday loan, title loan, or personal loan",Installment loan,Struggling to pay your loan,None,"On XXXX XXXX XXXX I placed an order through the XXXX XXXX app for a purchase of hair products from XXXX XXXX Products. On Monday XXXX XXXX XXXX I wrote into XXXX stating that the package seemed to have been stuck at some XXXX facility. I called the carrier and was told that they could not initiate a search because I was not the sender of the package. Only the sender could start a process for a missing package. This was why I reached out to XXXX. They assured me that the package would be delivered. After another week passed and I didn't receive a package or follow up, I filed a complaint with Affirm who manages payments for XXXX XXXX. I needed the package for an international trip I was taking so at that point I wanted to cancel and find the products somewhere local. I contact Affirm to initiate the dispute and they took care of it immediately. 

In finally received the package on XX/XX/XXXX and notified both the seller ( XXXX XXXX XXXX ) and Affirm immediately. This is where it gets frustrating because neither company seemed to want to work with me. Affirm 's website says that if you do receive a product after a dispute, you must resolve the issue with the seller. I reached back out to XXXX again telling them I DID receive the product but needed a way to pay for it. Once Affirm started the dispute on their site, I was unable to make any payments in their app from that point forward. I wrote them and asked about it, no answer. I wrote back to XXXX again saying the case was still in dispute and I don't have a way to pay for the product I already have. Buying a new set on their site wouldn't pay for the one I had so I asked for an invoice to be sent to me. I never received it. All of my loans with Affirm except this one have been paid off in full. 

About two weeks after my early return from my trip to see family in XXXX, I had to have emergency XXXX on my XXXX XXXX to repair a detached XXXX. After trying to make an XXXX purchase and was denied citing this very purchase that I wasn't given the opportunity to repay and address because no one has responded to my report of receiving a product that was presumed lost. I contacted Affirm again on XX/XX/XXXXXXXX  explained what happened and their customer service said they would help me. The person I spoke to said he escalated the issue to another department and that they would get back to me. No one got back to me. Instead, my report was closed saying that Affirm does not report to any credit reporting agency. Well how does that help me cure this loan from XXXX and clear my name with Affirm for nonpayment? How can I be listed as delinquent by any company simply because they just won't provide me with the opportunity to resolve an issue and the seller doesn't seem to have any motivation to collect the money? I don't understand how this can be? How can MY ability to get funding on a major platform like XXXX be this impacted in this way? I am being denied for an issue that I didn't cause and I am not in any way trying to avoid paying this money. I'm perplexed rather, that I have had to chase people down to give them this {$58.00} they don't seem to want. 

Finally I called Affirm again on XX/XX/XXXX to explain how the last response I got doesn't resolve the issue and the person I spoke with told me this all happened because I did not call and make a payment. I was infuriated even more after all of the contact I had with Affirm to resolve the issue, at no point did any customer service person I spoke with ever give me the option to make the payment to them over the phone. Affirm 's own policy states that once the dispute has been started, any further payment MUST be made to the seller. I am filing a complaint because this is XXXX  XXXX  knowing the consumer will be punished for this and they will recover those funds by charging the loan off. I believe it is illegal to charge a loan off without ever having given the consumer an opportunity to repay said loan. Please help me. This just doesn't make any sense at all. This is exactly the kind of thing consumers need protection from. I have copies of all my correspondences. 

I have chosen to never purchase from XXXX XXXX XXXX again because of this. The case with Affirm is a bit different in that they are the only XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX company that XXXX uses. Because of this issue with Affirm, I am unable to access XXXX on XXXX 's platform. With Affirm being so heavily integrated into so many major sellers this is equal to a denial of credit, service just as if it were on my credit report.

I got approved for a loan on XX/XX/XXXX with the company Arrowhead Advance in the amount of {$1500.00}. During a phone conversation with their agent in XXXX of XXXX, I asked their agent why they had a grossly inflated rate of 780.16 % on their contract which made no sense ( something I had never seen before ), she told me not to worry about it, that I could pay off the loan early and not incur any additional interest. The agent told me I could either pay off the full amount of {$1500.00} quickly within a month or two and incur only I month of finance charge equal to {$380.00} which is the same as making five payments of {$380.00} which amounted to {$1900.00}.

I told them I was very angry by their deceit, that this was not what I had been told, that their interest rate was outrageous and that I would never have agreed to their outrageous terms if their agent had not tricked me, and that there were abusing and stealing from consumers. I also told them I would be filing a CFPB complaint for consumer violations, as I did not authorize the XXXX transaction on my account, would be disputing it with my bank and was disputing the validity of the remaining debt they were claiming any and all additional interest finance charges as this was grossly unfair and unreasonable because their agent had told me that If I paid off my loan early I would not incur any additional finance charges on their unreasonable grossly abusive contract.

Several companies responded using a soft pull with amounts allowed as well as percentage rates. One Main had the best quoted rate and I responded to that offer.

I asked her why would the computer approve a different amount when NOTHING changed between the initial offer and that day. All income was verified, nothing changed. I sent a complaint to One Main, XXXX. I received a phone call on XX/XX/XXXX from a lady who explained One Main was allowed to amend the offer, she also explained that I had approved the hard pull by submitting the forms on XX/XX/XXXX. One Main baited me by showing a lower APR and higher amount and then switching the numbers. In doing this they made a hard pull on my credit by apparently placing the hard pull language into a fine print message. Once a hard pull is done aquiring any loan from another vendor becomes impossible because the soft pull will show the pull by One Main.

Hello, Thank you for your email. I am unsure of the conversation you had with XXXX and XXXX, this contract is a future receivables purchase and sales agreement. There is the purchase price of {$10000.00} and a purchased amount, which will be turned over to QuickBridge in the amount of {$15000.00}. Your remittance due weekly, every Tuesday is {$350.00}. The processing fee is a one time fee and is not included in the repayment of the contract.

The 4 % retrieval rate is what we use to generate your weekly remittance, based on your business revenue. 4 % of you revenue is what will be paid to QuickBridge weekly. Currently the balance remaining on this contract is {$12000.00}. Your agreement is still in range for a discount, but do to the breach of the agreement - stop pay - you do not qualify for this discount. 

We will not accept your offer of {$7100.00}, as you are still responsible for the remaining {$5000.00}. If you do not wish to lift the stop pay, or provide your statements requested, we will escalate the contract to our legal team for further litigation.

Two weeks ago, I settled a car loan that was registered with XXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXX Loan Mart, and according to my records, I have cleared the payment for this lien in full. As a resident of Florida, I am aware of our state 's electronic title system which mandates that once a lien on a vehicle is paid off, the financial institution is obligated to release the lien within ten days.

I am requesting your immediate attention to rectify the matter as it has adversely affected my credit score and is impeding my ability to purchase a home for my family.

To provide you with the necessary details, at one point, I had a credit line with Synchrony Bank through XXXX XXXX XXXX. I am pleased to inform you that I have responsibly managed my account and have successfully paid off the entire balance in full. However, to my surprise, I recently discovered that Synchrony Bank claims that I owe them an additional sum of {$20.00}, despite the fact that my account was settled and closed. 

I must emphasize that I have not received any correspondence from Synchrony Bank, whether in the form of letters or emails, regarding this alleged outstanding balance. I maintain meticulous records of my financial transactions, and I can provide evidence that my account has been paid off in its entirety. This unexpected discrepancy has caused a significant decline in my credit score, which has a direct impact on my ability to secure financing for our first home.

Given the gravity of the situation and the urgency it demands, I kindly request your immediate attention to rectify this matter. I implore you to conduct a thorough investigation into my account to verify that it has been settled. Furthermore, I request that Synchrony Bank promptly correct my credit report, removing any negative remarks or indications of an outstanding balance, as it is unjust and inaccurate. 

It is my sincere hope that this issue can be resolved expeditiously and amicably. I have always strived to maintain a positive credit history, and this incident is an unfortunate anomaly that I trust can be promptly addressed. 

I kindly request that you provide written confirmation of the resolution reached, including any adjustments made to my credit report, within 15 business days of receiving this letter. I would also appreciate a direct point of contact should further communication be necessary during this process. 

I look forward to your prompt response and a swift resolution to this matter. Thank you for your immediate attention and understanding.

The first complaint was done on XX/XX/XXXX and it was closed on XX/XX/XXXX stating that the TitleMax responded but they never did. I hit a financial hardship and I cant pay them anymore. In XXXX I was making $ XXXX $ XXXX  monthly payments for a {$2100.00} line of credit. As of XX/XX/XXXX I am no longer able to pay on the loan. I paid {$3100.00} on the loan so far and I still owe {$2800.00}. I was not aware that they were charging me over 180 % in interest, I never signed anything that showed the interest amount. This is my first time ever doing a line of credit with TitleMax, I usually would get a title loan that needs to be repaid within 30 days. The person at the office insisted I get the line of credit because Ill be saving more in fees. That was a lie I have been struggling to pay them and to keep my only barely working vehicle. In XXXX right before XXXX I had major car problems and the state of TN sent me a letter because I dont have car insurance and requesting I get it within 30 days. I was paying TitleMax so much money that I couldnt maintain car insurance or maintenance. I am a single mother and I home school my XXXX children. I am on section 8 and my title loan payments are more then my rent. I cant get my tags reinstated or get insurance on the vehicle because TitleMax said if I cant make a payment then I need to drop it off at their office and take a XXXX back home. I reached out to the General Manager and the Office Manager about working out a payment plan to stop the interest from getting so high. They said they spoke to the District Manager and he or she said there is nothing they can do for me and I need to pay the past due and start making monthly payments. I tried coming up with the money but I couldnt. I had to reschedule my son and Daughter Doctors appointments 3 times because of this and not being able to have up to date tags and insurance. This is frustrating and hard. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  and TitleMax is making it hard for me to even do that. I need my vehicle I also need them to do something about this. I paid the loan off!! How am I still owing the same amount? I need my title and I will never go to them again. I will be sure to share my experience on their reviews everywhere! This was a trap. I even called them in XXXX to come get the vehicle thats when the manager told me to drop it off at their office. Here we are almost 2 months later and the interest and amount is steadily rising. They are scamming hard working families and dont have no remorse. My hours has decreased and Im barely making {$1200.00} a month. I can barely feed my family because I was paying TitleMax.

So i paid that. Then there was still {$8.00}. At this point i realized my monthly payments were being misrepresented and the fees theyre charging now arent represented at all. I dont have access to the documentation they say is provided in my account on there website. Nor is there any transaction history. And in the end she claimed she didnt know why it was doing that but she is not responsible for how the system charges.

The loan term says same as cash which i never knew how it works since they never provided any information. However it says the payment is not due until XXXX this year, XXXX. Fine so I have set up an automated bill pay in ADVANCE for the monthly {$300.00} on XX/XX/XXXX. At the same time I have tried to contact enerbank to find out exactly what's my exact balance is due. Therefore, I couldn't get a hold of anyone. The website didn't work for me neither the phone call to obtain the balance i needed to pay. Most of the times its 30 to 45 minutes call wait time and the call gets dropped after certain time. Anyway I was making random payments such as {$7000.00}, {$3000.00}, {$2000.00} within one month. Then on XX/XX/XXXX, after so many attempt, I finally got a hold of a live EnerBank customer service adviser. When I asked about the remaining balance he said I still have some small balance left but also there is interest occurred. I asked the associate to take the remaining balance over the phone immediately, which he did and there shouldn't be any balance left on the account. Then I tried to explain to him that's why i called many times to find out the balance but its almost impossible to talk to someone. If there is any interest which unintentionally happened due to the fact not to get a hold of anyone. Then the associate told me that supervisor is in a meeting but he will call me back to resolve the matter. Nearly one month later on XX/XX/XXXX i got to talk to a different adviser in EnerBank, and explained the situation again that i was expecting a call back from your superior but then i never received any call. the she said the same thing supervisor is in a meeting and she will expedite the matter and supervisor should call me the very same day. Unfortunately no one called at that day. Then i tried to learn about the bank and found some interesting facts. That's how they do bad practices in the name of bank.

The excessive amount of times, assertiveness, confidence, tone, and amount of times agents told me indicated that their agents are trained to do so. 
Onemain reviewed calls for quality assurance and suggested that it was ok to do so. They've reached out to my family members. I should have got an Attorney for them, but I couldn't afford to. I was laid off on XX/XX/XXXX, and the last payment that I was able to make was on XX/XX/XXXX. I was separating from my husband at that time because he had XXXX and XXXX. He gets 100 % XXXX, and that was how I still tried to pay, and that amount of money was not enough for a family of XXXX While reviewing the contract sent to me on XX/XX/XXXX, the finance amount was {$10000.00}, and a prepaid fee of {$510.00}. But on my credit report, it is listed as a high balance of {$10000.00}. According to my credit report, the account shows the debt charged off. Oemmain wrote off the debt and reported it as a loss on XX/XX/XXXX. I started working on XX/XX/XXXX. At that time, I was playing catch up with all my bills, and the account was impossible. My credit report from then and now shows the inconsistencies of violating the fair credit reporting act. Since they continued to go back to court to garnish my wages and anything, they could do to get money. They also tried to go after my ex-husband and his sole and separate property in SC. Clearly showing only his name on the deed. 
Ihave the correspondence from Onemain via email, and I can also get my phone records to verify the communication and how often agents called me and my family members. Onemain attached the unsigned contract agreement but did not provide any documentation supporting the calculated amount claimed. The amount claimed is excessively more than the original loan amount Onemain initially reported to credit reporting agencies, again reported as a wrote-off loss of a charged off account. The judgment was approved because I was never formally served. Also, the documentation provided by Onemain verifying that they formally served me ; shows a picture of my neighbor 's home, not mine. The proof of service also proves the lack of care, due diligence, and reckless practices of Onemains. Updated documents prepared and mailed to me from Oemains Attorneys show additional fees and interest charges added to the already approved judgment amount, which continues to increase.

This lender has violated the Truth in Lending, Usuary Laws and has been reporting inaccurately on my account that displays on my credit report which violates FCRA Regulations. 
I financed a XXXX XXXX XXXX in XX/XX/XXXX. The initial balance financed was {$23000.00}. 
The current balance now as of XX/XX/XXXX is {$22000.00}. Next month will be a year since Ive been paying on the loan and my total balance has only been reduced by {$1200.00}. 
For starters, Credit Acceptance has violated XXXX Usuary Laws by charging me over 16 % in interest for this loan. My rate is at 19.99 % annum. This is predatory lending. 
They gave me an option to make payments bi-monthly on the XXXX of each month and the XXXX of each month based on when I got paid when I signed the contract but still continue to charge me late fees each month after the XXXX of the month. Why set up this arrangement if late fees will be incurred. Even though, I have made several full payments within 30 days, they report my account 30-60 days late because of late fees. 
This lender does not look out for the best interest of the customer. 
Furthermore, 12 CFR Part 1026 - Truth in Lending ( Regulation Z ) has been violated which states in Subpart C : ( 3 ) Subpart C relates to closed-end credit. It contains rules on disclosures, treatment of credit balances, annual percentage rate calculations, rescission requirements, and advertising.

Credit Acceptance is telling me that my current pay-off is good through XX/XX/XXXX is {$22000.00} but is not fully disclosing how they came to this pay-off amount based on the payments Ive made for almost a year. This is a violation of Regulation Z pertaining to installment loans and closed-end credit. I called Credit Acceptance on XX/XX/XXXX after receiving a payment history statement. The representative assured that everything was correct and there were no violations. I noticed that my initial balance on the statement had been {$39000.00}. This is the total balance I would pay after 66 months but I am being charged the full interest and priciple combined. 
I am requesting that my account be reviewed and that this situation be rectified within 30-days according to FCRA regulations. I have attached, a payment history and my initial contract for this vehicle.

They are also reporting this debt illegally to the credit bureaus. I have attempted to resolve this issue directly with the company on multiple occasions. The company provides conflicting information regarding the status of my account and refuses to provide requested information. 

XXXX XXXX has a history of engaging in illegal practices with consumers and this time is no different. I initially purchased this lease to own furniture from XXXX XXXX online. XXXX XXXX offered me the Koalafi financing but did not disclose the usurious interest rates involved. My initial purchase was around {$4000.00} for XXXX dining table, XXXX coffee table, and XXXX end tables. After the first month, Koalafi claimed that I owed a total of {$14000.00}! I called the company immediately and discussed the balance. Obviously that is a ridiculous amount of money for XXXX tables. I told the representative that I could not afford this debt and wanted to return the tables. The representative advised that she would notate the account and a representative would call me to schedule the return. 

I waited for a week or XXXX and never received a phone call. I called and asked to speak to the returns department and could not get anyone on the phone as they were busy with a "" high call volume ''. I told the representative that this isn't right and it seemed as if they were delaying the return to continue to charge me money illegally! Another month of contact attempts passes. I spoke to a different representative who states that she will enter the return request again. This time the return request was entered correctly and Koalafi picked up the tables within a few days. The tables were picked up by XXXX men in a standard pick up truck, not a company vehicle. I have requested proof of the return in writing to confirm the returned merchandise was received. This company refuses to provide written proof of return which is illegal. The company also continues to charge me for the returned merchandise. They also continue to report my account as delinquent to the credit bureaus every month. 

Furthermore, my online account shows an unrelated charge off amount of {$2900.00}! The business practices are unscrupulous and illegal. I was told I have to pay a minimum of {$1700.00} in order to close the account. They are essentially overcharging me for furniture that I do not have any longer and continuing to report the account as open and delinquent on my consumer credit report. 

In accordance with the Fair Credit Reporting act, the account listed below has violated my federally protected consumer rights to privacy and confidentiality under 15 USC 1681.

15 U.S.C 1681 Section 602 A states I have the right to privacy 15 U.S.C 1681 Section 604 A Section 2 : It also states a consumer reporting agency can not furnish an account without my written instructions.

I made several calls and sent emails requesting to cancel the savings account portion and each time I was told they couldn't cancel the savings account portion.

I also use another cash in advance company so I have a pretty good idea of how the system works. I am a XXXX senior on both XXXX XXXX and XXXX so I get a check on the first and the third but I get my loans for the third because thats when the larger check comes. In XXXX I went to Check N Go on XXXX XXXX in XXXX XXXX Mi where I began to loan since I recently moved to the area, in the beginning it was fine and the customer service was good. Suddenly I noticed many of the friendly faces that were there began to disappear and the XXXX regular face that stayed was XXXX, hes an older guy who I assume became the manager. XXXX is a big guy who has a deep voice and he sometimes try to come across as being intimidating even grumpy at times. I took out a loan for {$600.00} in XXXX and because XX/XX/XXXX fell on a Saturday, I asked if I could pay back my loan on Saturday since it is a busy day for this store. I have repaid loans on Saturday at other locations and also at this store before, but XXXX said you get paid on Friday, I replied that I know and he continued to service me. Now assuming he had granted my request we finished our business and I left the store. I found out in XXXX that he may my payday for the XXXX and deposited my check because I was prepared to call in my payment on the XXXX as I always do. I have been in XXXX XXXX for over 30 years and received many awards and letters of recognition for my service, the reason I call in my payment and come back later to reloan is because this store is always crowded on the XXXX and XXXX so we have to wait for hours because they dont have enough help and XXXX XXXX elderly and slow himself, trying to wait on customers and answering the busy phone. Check N Go closed a lot of locations last year so this added more customers to locations already crowded, many seniors have no choice but to endure this situation and it would seem since there is a 30 day payment policy we should be able to choose the days available to us within that time frame. Customers often complain that they need more help at this location and XXXX doesnt help with his attitude and slow service. This is bad for business and Im sure people who have a choice are going to other places.

I opened a personal loan in XXXX with Axos Bank ( XXXX XXXX, NV ). The loan was to consolidate debt and I have been paying my monthly payments for three years. With student loans restarting this summer, I am trying to get in a better financial position and I decided to use a bonus from my employer to pay off the personal loan. I contacted Axos Bank since they do not allow for payoff through their website. The only way to pay off the personal loan is a wire transfer or to send a check to their XXXX XXXX location. I received the pay off information from Axos, which included the wire instructions. I followed the instruction that I was provided and sent the wire on XX/XX/XXXX. My bank, XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX, let me know the wire would take about 3 business days, so Axos would receive the pay off of {$9700.00} on XX/XX/XXXX or XXXX. Axos must receive the pay off within 10 days, or they add interest and then I would need to go through another pay off to close the loan, so I decided to wire the money to ensure it reached the bank on time. 

Again, I followed Axos instructions include their routing and account number. I did not hear from Axos and did not see the pay off credited to my account on XX/XX/XXXX, two - three business days after the pay off was supposed to arrive so I emailed Axos through their website on XX/XX/XXXX. I did not receive a call or email back, so I started calling the bank on XX/XX/XXXX trying to find out when the payment would be processed. Axos customer care center is the only number I can find for the bank and I was informed by that team they can not find the wire transfer. After several calls on XX/XX/XXXX & XXXX - I realized and confirmed with their call center that Axos sent me an incorrect Demand Statement or pay off letter and the account number is wrong. Axos did receive the money as the routing number is correct, but now Axos can not find the money even though it arrived at their bank. I have asked to speak with their wire or account teams, but their care center team refuses to transfer me to anyone outside their care center. On my sixth call to the bank in three days, I finally was transferred to a supervisor, who was not helpful and basically said I need to get more information from XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX. My monthly loan payment is set to debit from my account towards the end of XXXX ( XXXX I believe ) and will deduct another {$650.00} from my account on top pf the {$9700.00}. I have done everything Axos has asked in terms of providing receipts from the wire transactions and I have reached out to XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX to request additional information on Axos behalf and provided that information to Axos, but that is still not enough. I am really frustrated and Axos takes no responsibility for this issue, even though their employee provided the wrong info and I feel like I am stuck and soon to be out over {$10000.00} and will still owe on my loan if this does not get resolved. I am not sure what the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau can do, but anything you can do to assist in resolving this matter so I am not out more money would be a blessing and greatly appreciated.

Long story short, I changed the payment account on this app from one checking account to another to be auto-debited for paying the installments. This payment account update never happened on OneMains side, even though on the app it said the payment account was successfully updated. Therefore, I went a handful of months not knowing I had missed/late installment payments. This has negatively affected my credit score unfairly as I was unaware that OneMain wasnt getting paid. I did what I was supposed to do! 

I was then told over the phone that they are aware their app doesnt work and theyre sorry about the mix up Sorry doesnt fix my credit score. They told me I had to update my payment account over the phone. This was the only way to do so why do they allow you to update your payment account on the app and on their website then? This is misleading and VERY harmful.

When I tried to update my payment account with them over the phone, the person on a recorded line sent me 2 verification emails she said I had to sign two documents to successfully update my account with them. I only received one email. I never received the other that would finalize this change. You can hear my frustration on the recording.

Several months later we found out this program was through Comenity Bank. We believe Comenity Bank acted fraudulently in this matter causing me many, many hours on the phone with customer service reps apparently reading scripts, much duress, damage to my credit score, negative financial impact on my resources, and the problem is still continuing. 
When we opened this account at the store we were told we would receive documentation concerning this financing, account information etc. in the mail. During the months of XXXX, XXXX and XXXX we called the store XXXX times, we were concerned because we hadn't received paperwork or a bill. We were told they looked into it, everything was normal and we should be receiving it. It should also be noted that during this period I received several ( XXXX or XXXX ) phone calls from a restricted number, which I didn't answer. I only know XXXX person who calls on a restricted number which I don't answer but he will leave a message. This is where the scam on XXXX 's part begins. On XXXX XXXX, I received a call from a restricted number, this time they left a message. It was concerning my delinquent account and I was to contact them so they could help me with it. Interesting that no messages were left until my account was delinquent, interest and fees had kicked in. As shown in my credit report the account was shown XXXX for XXXX and XXXX, and then XXXX for XXXX. Not knowing if this was a legitimate call we went to the store on XXXX XXXX. 
The XXXX said there was nothing he could do, we were on our own with the bank. We spent an hour and a half on the phone while in the store, and gave up, deciding to resume call on the way home. After hours of listening to a customer service rep reading scripts and telling me nothing they could do, I was put through to a XXXX, XXXX, XXXX. She repeatedly said basically the same things. They knew the bills and paperwork were going to the wrong address ( they were being returned to them ). they contacted me XXXX times ( the calls on a restricted number with no message ) but she didn't know how the phone system worked. They could have emailed, left a message, or contacted the XXXX XXXX which they didn't. I wanted to get a statement right away so I wouldn't be late with this months payment, but she said they couldn't do that and we would be delinquent again building up more fees and interest and further damage to my credit score. We were then basically bullied into paying {$570.00} immediately, which we did, and without being able to see a statement. We had to give payment information to her because at this point we still didn't know our account number so couldn't pay online.

I would find out my account number when I received my card in about XXXX days. I did not receive an email with the requested statement.

I purchased solar energy  from XXXX XXXX XXXX to save money and help the planet. XXXX  assigned my financing to GoodLeap Finance. Disastrous consequences started immediately after installation. These devastated my finances, home, state of mind, and well-being. Interactions, conversations, names, and dates are documented in the ( XXXX 's. ) I can't stress how critical these are to my case, so I appreciate your kind attention. 

False promises by XXXXXXXX  salesperson were unethically misrepresented. Had I known the truth, I would not have signed up, knowing Id never been able to afford it. Very quickly the five biggest financial reasons I signed up for, evaporated to crushing effect. These false promises were repeatedly and deceptively emphasized as part of the program. ( XXXX. 1a False Promises, 1b Promised Incentives from the salesperson, XXXX XXXX ) Next, XXXX  techs found major damage on the roof and inside my home, due to faulty installation. These findings were verified and confirmed by two XXXX  tech teams, XXXX  insurance adjuster, and two contracting companies that XXXX had selected to inspect and submit quotes, as well as, my personal homeowners insurance adjuster from XXXX XXXX. ( XXXX. 1c XXXX XXXX Inspection, 1d XXXX XXXX Estimate ) The XXXX  electrician negligently added extra wiring inside my house, above my original breaker box by means of cutting a large unorthodox section out of my dining room wall. This was to ostensibly boost my already full-capacity system. I questioned this because it didn't seem up to code. ( Picture XXXX, Unorthodox Electrical Wiring ) Proved Damages Caused : * Extensive roof damage, * Leaky attic, ceilings, and wet insulation, * Mold damage, * Electrical problems, * Warped walls, and, * Cracks in ceilings and joints. 

To make matters worse, XXXX discovered that XXXX  incorrectly installed the panels in reverse. Consequently, the system never worked properly, and now it is causing system-wide glitches. XXXX XXXX verified, The solar production barely put a dent in the power usage from the start. All parties agreed that the faulty XXXX  installation caused the damages. These repairs are needed immediately. 

I fruitlessly began to pursue XXXX. They were now responsible to : * Remove the system, Replace the entire roof, * Fix the interior of my home, * Remediate mold problems, * Mitigate faulty wiring, glitches, and damaged outlets, * Reimburse all loan payments, * Void GoodLeap loan and, * Restore any negative credit reporting as a result. 

Months before their bankruptcy, XXXX  accepted responsibility for all damages and agreed to make all repairs and to refund the money paid to GL. The catch : they would only resolve the issues under the condition of reinstalling the system and keeping the loan in place. ( XXXX 's 1e XXXX XXXX Reimbursements XXXX 1f Email from XXXX  XXXX ) I said no for many justified reasons. The biggest : before installation the roof must first pass inspection by an engineer verifying the integrity of the roof. PE sent the engineering firm, XXXX to do the inspection. XXXX certified, by letter, my roof to be in sound and stable condition for installation. This roof should not have had one single issue, period. ( 1g XXXX Engineering Inspection Letter ) Further, XXXX adjuster ( XXXX XXXX ) tried to coax me with a check far under the repair cost, and with the understanding that I would have no option but to reinstall the system. I said NO for the reasons I stated above. ( 1h XXXX Damage Offer ) Also, more than once, I contacted GoodLeap manager XXXX XXXX for help, after it was apparent that there were big problems. I asked for a payment suspension until XXXX  straightened out the complications. He said it's possible, but not advised because of several factors involved. He advised that interest still accrues, "" I'd pay service charges, have to complete paperwork, and the looming amortization issue was still impending. '' He said he had "" pull '' with XXXX   and would call to see what he could work out. Ineffectively, he never resolved anything. When I called back, It sounded like his main concern was that I continue paying the loan, despite everything. 

XXXX  slipshod workmanship, sketchy ethics, and customer service lack any integrity. Their business model appeared built on lies, deception, bait and switch, and then passively hostile non-communication to mitigate home damages and system operation. Therefore, I was not willing to allow XXXX to reinstall after they made all repairs. Why would I risk this nightmare ever happening again?! 

My insurance agent says my homeowners policy covers weather-related damages only, not losses due to faulty construction. Now I have no way to fix my home! ( 1i XXXX Denial Letter ) These issues are still not resolved. As long as this system remains on my roof, the conditions will continue to worsen and become even more dangerous. I fear that if it is not removed now, the roof will completely cave in, due to its now weakened state, burn down from the overloaded erroneous wiring/glitches, and or, I will suffer health issues from the invasive mold growth! 

XXXX  has left me with no recourse to fix my home or finances. 
I desperately need help now! 

Furthermore, and this is huge, GoodLeap used no due diligence to fully qualify my loan. Without the promised incentives I depended on to make this loan even make financial sense, my single income of {$16000.00} would not support such an over-inflated loan of {$88000.00}. ( XXXX. 1j, Energy Tax Credit and my Tax Returns ) To qualify, their only requirement is to have a XXXX-point, credit score. 
Had they bothered to ask for my financial information, they would have stopped and recognized that I was not a viable candidate for this loan. They simply ran with my meager score of XXXX. 

In my case, this does not accurately prove what I could afford, since I have had no credit cards for over 25 years and have a minimal credit history. I asked my salesperson when GoodLeap would need my financial information. He said they would call when they needed it. They never did. NCDOJ agreed that this loan is suspect and that I should also file a claim against them. ( XXXX. XXXX GoodLeap Finance Contract. ) I was promised to save, at least, {$50.00} per month on energy costs and no longer have an energy bill. This was NOT true. Instead, I ended up paying both the GoodLeap loan and energy bill totaling about {$750.00} per month, which financially crushed me. 

The promised incentives would have reduced the amount of my loan substantially. My low, single income simply could never support this financial burden. Therefore, I would never have signed up to pay two bills, and also, not get the 26 % back, let alone all the other promised incentives to reduce my loan amount. My goal was to save money! Who would sign up to go into financial ruin?! Again, all these promises were just a ploy to get me to sign. 

Presently, nothing XXXX XXXX XXXX or Goodleap Finance have done, has any value whatsoever. Quite adversely, they have destroyed the integrity of my home and ruined my finances, state of mind, and well-being. The landslide effects of having to pay two bills, the anxiety, frustration, lack of sleep, work missed, and time spent documenting, calling, emailing, time waiting, ETC., combined, have greatly taken a toll on my life as I knew it. 

These two companies claim to not be in partnership, per se, but they clearly are in league with one another, pulling in tremendous profits. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX with its misrepresentations of its program and its over-inflated prices, and GoodLeap not fully qualifying their loans has trapped me as a victim in this nightmare.

Both companies know full well that the 26 % government incentive and all the other incentives are not a given, as they promised. They conveniently left out the fact that you must qualify for the incentive. These were just sales tactics and lies to entice me to sign. 

It is unconscionably that they are able to devastate my home and finances and just leave me with no means to fix it. These dreadful events clearly point to the fact that this loan is unethical and unscrupulous in nature. Yet Im being asked to pay an astronomical amount ( past my life expectancy ) for the next 25 years ; for a loan that was based on lies and deceit and that I shouldnt even have qualified for in the first place, for a system that never worked and ruined my home! 

Thank you for your help!

This company 's location at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX CO is one of two locations this complaint pertains to. The second location, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, is the second location. 

This complaint pertains to the following : 1. Stores not using the current, actual gold price when estimating value of gold items; misleading consumers in the valuation of their gold. 

2. Pawn brokers not researching actual values of items and instead, making subjective assessments based upon their personal likes, or dislikes, of their consumers- enabling a culture of XXXX and XXXX discrimination in pawn loan services. 

3. Pawn brokers misplacing, or stealing, customer 's property. Collateral used toward cash loans at both locations has disappeared. 

On XX/XX/23 I came to the XXXX XXXX XXXX store in XXXX XXXX to get a loan on collateral that has been used previously. I have a 100 % redemption rate which means I never intend to leave any collateral at this store ; always return and pay off my loans and interest completely. Staff has commented previously that they've never seen any customer get so much money in loans that has a 100 % redemption rate meaning, I'm honest. 

Today, XXXX, a bad pawnbroker with a track record of errors and omissions, was unfortunately the individual who approached me for help. He said "" XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX' and then continued to make other XXXX derogatory and discriminatory comments toward me. 

Despite the value of the collateral presented, past loan on the item, and my reiterating my interest in a loan, not a sale, XXXX commented that while I intended to get a loan and pay it off to get my collateral back, that was not his plan for my item. He literally said to me "" You may think you're going to come back to get your item but that's YOUR plan .... '' This is an interesting comment especially considering prior audit findings of missing items at this store. 

XXXX would not provide me with a loan. He continued to reiterated that he wanted to buy item, not give me a loan for it. 

Both this store and the XXXX XXXX location has pawn brokers who are misleading consumers in providing a fair valuation of fine jewelry based upon current gold prices. The stores do not update their daily gold price and I've witnessed several defective, out of date gold testing solution kits and diamond testers that do not work.

03/11/23,"Payday loan, title loan, or personal loan",Personal line of credit,Problem with additional add-on products or services,None,"on the week of XXXX i purchased a course online via webinar that i signed up for through XXXX. it was from XXXX XXXX from the XXXX XXXX XXXX, here is the link i used during his webinar to purchase the product. 

https : XXXX Throughout the webinar, XXXX pitched his product, and during his webinar before even purchasing, he presented a slide which I have attached is a screenshot that shows him offering a 30 day zero risk moneyback guarantee to try the product. 

I wanted to try the product and saw that he offered affirm payments as an option so I used affirm to open a loan for his course After XXXX DAYS of using the product, I felt that it would not work for me and I wanted to return it so I tried looking for his contact information on purchased course website. There was no contact information on the website, so I proceeded to reach out via XXXX on his profile to try and get my refund ( screenshots attached ) instead of acknowledging my refund request, he only tried to sell me something else, and from then on, proceeded to ignore me. 

I reached out to affirm payments and opened a dispute over this, and time and time again they would come back to me, saying that they were in favor of the merchant becasue as they state, the product was non refundable. 

I explained to them that it is conflicting statements to say that a product has a 30 day moneyback guarantee and also be non refundable which in my favor many of the affirm customer support team members ive spoken too are in my favor. 

Since XXXX I have been back-and-forth with affirm payments, disputing this fraudulent and deceptive activity from the XXXX standard academy. 

The merchant tried submitting a screenshot of his check out with a note saying nonrefundable, but it is not the same check out as I used, which is on the live link I provided above ( https : XXXX ) His counter evidence to back his claim, didn't even match where I purchased the product, after I explained that to the dispute team, they began to tell me that I only had 30 days to return the product and told me that it expired in XXXX, I haven't purchased the product till XXXX. 

At that point both the merchant, and affirm are claiming fraudulent things. 

the merchant can not advertise a 30 day moneyback, guarantee, and say that the product is also nonrefundable at the same time that is a deceptive business practice with conflicting statements, AFFIRM PAYMENTS fails to acknowledge that conflict and continues to be in favor of a merchant, thus facilitating fraudulent merchants on their platform",None,"Affirm Holdings, Inc",FL,33161,None,Consent provided,Web,03/11/23,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,6681136

04/21/23,"Payday loan, title loan, or personal loan",Installment loan,Charged fees or interest you didn't expect,None,"I visited XXXX XXXX XXXX located on XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX in XXXX, New Jersey. I stumbled upon the business a week earlier while driving through XXXX after leaving a different XXXX  officeXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX located a few blocks over. I initially visited them to get a consultation however they didn't have any immediate availability until XX/XX/XXXX. I wanted a consultation a bit sooner. So, as a mental note, I snapped a picture of the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX sign so that I could look them up later on. 

Fast Forward back to XX/XX/XXXX, I decided to look them up via XXXX and get their contact information while at work. I called them, and spoke with the receptionist, her name is XXXX, to inquire about scheduling a consultation, she stated that they had immediate availability and that I could come in the same day. I dropped everything and headed to their office. I met XXXX XXXX XXXX, we spoke briefly, formal greetings, before heading to get my XXXX taken by his XXXX assistant, very personable. After my XXXX were taken, I was escorted to his chair. I shared in detail what I was looking to get done, which was Porcelain Veneers for my top row of teeth.  I showed him a picture of what I was looking for which was a picture of XXXX, XXXX XXXX. Thats whose smile I admired and wanted to encapsulate. He agreed that he could make it happen, and then further suggested that We/ I get a complete smile makeover. Feeling encouraged by his response, I shared with him my ongoing insecurities about my smile, due to a freak accident that i had as a teenager, I tripped while running and hit a fence pole ( which resulted in me cracking my front tooth which was shoved up into my upper gums- Very TRAUMATIC experience for me ), I've had braces ( didn't help much ), but it wasn't what I wanted, I wanted a BETTER smile, I wanted XXXX XXXX and that it's something that I've been wanting to do for YEARS, I literally saved up cash money for this very procedure, I was turning XXXX XXXX XXXX in XXXX, and did not want to spend more years feeling insecure about my smile. It literally has affected my professional career, to an extent, and I wanted to address it with expediency. 

After reviewing my XXXX  and XXXX XXXX determining that he can make it possible for me to get XXXX XXXX, I began to ask him questions about the procedure in terms of pricing. He didn't share the amount immediately, but he did ask me about my credit. I shared that my score was XXXX ( XXXX ), and that I had {$14000.00} cash set aside to pay towards the procedure. So on this very day, he immediately contacted his finance department that assists with the clients financing their procedures. In less than 30 minutes, I was approved. 

PRICE BREAKDOWN : The full amount came up to {$40000.00} which he said he would discount to {$36000.00}, which in reality was {$38000.00} ( See Treatment plan & Statement of Account receipt attached ) {$14000.00} cashiers check that I furnished - made payable to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. 

I had to finance through two different companies affiliated with the XXXX XXXX office ( see those documents & screenshots of approvals attached ) XXXX ). XXXX XXXX XXXX - XXXX was approved for {$12000.00} XXXX ). XXXX XXXXComenity BankXXXX I was approved for {$7500.00} 4. ) My XXXX Insurance, XXXX XXXX- they used my entire XXXX allotment- almost {$2000.00} XXXX. ) Patient Courtesy ( Discount ) {$4200.00} The specific veneers I agreed to pay for after being shown a chart with several types of veneers that would suit my needs, I chose a well known type also known as { LABIAL PORCELAIN VENEERS } which is a porcelain facial placed on the front of the teeth to structure for an even and perfect smile. Again I showed him a picture of XXXX XXXX teeth which is the look I desired, a natural looking smile. I made certain to emphasize the fact that I did NOT want my teeth to look like they were fake/big/bulky. He assured me that that would not be the case and that I was in good hands. I left the office that date encouraged and excited about the journey ahead to achieve my smile makeover. 

Dr.Trichas gave me a scheduled date of XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX am to begin imaging and impressions of my current teeth which included a crown bridge on my front tooth that needed to be removed and then to be prepped for the temporaries. All impressions were sent to a lab while I was provided temporaries in the meantime at the XX/XX/XXXX visit, while waiting on the permanent veneers to be installed on another scheduled date in XX/XX/XXXX. 

The first set of temporaries boasted a lot of discomfort for me. They were huge, it Hurt when I would try to chew anything, so I immediately shared my concern with XXXX XXXX, I then had a subsequent appointment scheduled for XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX ( see screenshot ) so he can help alleviate the discomfort. He ended up having to create another, smaller version of temporaries ( he contoured it a bit more this time ). It was a lot more bearable. Next appointment scheduled for Permanent Veneer installation was XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX. 

However, I MUST NOTE my Disdain because I was completely under the assumption that I was receiving the end-product I agreed to pay {$36000.00} for, which was well communicated to XXXX XXXX that he insisted I would be happy with the completion of the procedure. 
On XX/XX/XXXX, the day the permanent teeth were to be installed XXXX XXXX never explained the full procedure to me, nor explained if there was any need for modifications or issues with my teeth that would prevent me from obtaining the perfect smile I requested with the exact Labial Porcelain Veneers I paid for ( see treatment plan attached ). 
During the operation to my teeth as a patient I was totally unable to view what was taking place in my mouth by XXXX XXXX while conducting this transformation. 
Once he was done he stated I have the veneers and the look I anticipated for so long. Once the mirror was given to me I was told to smile and all I saw was white teeth which was a huge difference and a great tone to my face, however I explain to him that my lips and jaw was protruding which look very obvious looking at my face that the teeth was too big for my facial structure. 
He said that is the immediate appearance thats common for all his patients undergoing this type of procedure and that once the swelling goes down, I would be able to see the difference. 

Days after final installation I reached out, I made complaints to XXXX XXXX that I was not satisfied with the outcome due to the bulkiness of the teeth that didnt fit my face, and that I was experiencing discomfort while chewing ( again ), Extreme sensitivity, and my bite was NOT aligned. On XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX I had an appointment, He asked me to come in so he could see what he could do. He continued insisting that he can make bite adjustments and contour my teeth as small fixes assuming that would do the trick, but I wasn't happy at all! I constantly shared that this is NOT the end result I hoped for. 

I had another appointment on XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX, to AGAIN, try to arrive at a place of satisfactory, because I continue to have unsightly bulkiness and extreme sensitivity while chewing/biting. XXXX XXXX again, tried to contour some more, and attempted to further adjust my bite. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I traveled to XXXX, XXXX for vacation. While in XXXX, my fianc chose to start his process to get his teeth done with a well known dentist to many in the states. XXXX XXXX XXXX of XXXX XXXX XXXX in XXXX. So I made a mental note to question her once she completed the evaluation with my fianc for the purpose of identifying the work done on myself, so as a curiosity she allowed me to be seen for a consultation and informed me that I have all crowns in my mouth which explained the bulkiness of the teeth that didnt resemble the flat appearance of ACTUAL veneers. In complete befuddlement, I asked her what can I do to get the Labial Porcelain Veneers I requested and she disappointingly informed me that I was not able to receive that look anymore. 
After being fully educated at that moment with XXXX XXXX of XXXX XXXX XXXX, I learned that for veneers your teeth would have to be filed down no less than [ XXXX ] so that it can be placed on the exterior of each tooth. As for crowns, your teeth have to be shaved down even more at a [ XXXX ] to fit over the existing teeth. 
This means my teeth is shaved down too low to ever receive the look and product I paid so much money for because XXXX XXXX took the liberty to do a procedure I did not ask for without confirming with me what I thought about it or what I feel about it before he did a irreversible operation without my authorization, which was not in our Treatment plan agreement, nor does the paperwork I signed indicate a mouth full of crowns to the financial department that helped me fund with these installment loans that I am obligated to pay for ( with interest ). 
The paperwork submitted to each of the above financial companies also received the exact document I received that clearly stated. { LABIAL VENEERS } NOT { CROWNS }. 
I insisted after I returned from my vacation to XXXX with my fianc that I was going to address this issue with XXXX XXXX one last time with hopes he can explain what he did and what type of material he used to place in my mouth. 

Once I arrived back home to XXXX XXXX  I made it my business to reach out to XXXX XXXX for an appointment to simply record the meeting with him after now understanding from another doctor what happened. I brought a recorder since it is perfectly legal in my state of residence, New Jersey, which is a one consent state that allows you to take video or voice recording of any conversation to protect yourself as a consumer. 
On XX/XX/XXXX I walked in the office waiting to see XXXX XXXX. As I sat in the waiting room I mentioned the receptionist whom I ask purposely of her opinion for the record to identify why my teeth are so huge and bulky and her response was said on the recording that she didn't think they were bulky -looking but she sees what I mean. I made sure my Audio recorder ( see audio attached ) was on to get a full statement from the XXXX XXXX that seemed very upset and aggravated with a hint of frustration to my direct questions about crowns and veneers. What he stated made no sense to me, and very much not what I was told in the beginning or I would have never allowed myself to sit in his chair to do what he did to me without giving me the privilege as a client or consumer the option to decline or accept his method used. 
Now I have an irreversible situation that will not allow me to reach the perfect smile I worked so hard to achieve by saving all my funds accordingly to anticipate this process with great results for the money I was spending. 
I felt very much violated and discriminated against because of the XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  knowing that if I was of another XXXX I would not have been treated in such a manner with no regard to what I requested, nor any type of real explanation for so long. 
So I decided to contact the CFPB within the statute of limitations to report this dental office and specific dentist as well as the financial companies that were either lied to by XXXX XXXX of the type of procedure he was doing or participated in the type of procedure received. 
Either way, the paperwork never changed to identify the incorrect work done. ( CROWNS vs VENEERS ). 
In Conclusion, I would like to see the paperwork from each financial company : XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX in full detail that reveals the breakdown of the requested work that was to be performed by XXXX XXXX describing these services that I agreed to pay for. 
If this paperwork has not been corrected with either one of these companies I need an explanation why? And if the documents were changed, why did I not get the change order of the treatment plan paperwork as well clearly stating I received crowns and not Veneers and the reason why? I received NO FURTHER CONSULTATION from XXXX XXXX describing the need to install ALL Crowns vs LABIAL PORCELAIN VENEERS which is what I asked and agreed to pay for, per my attached treatment plan. Furthermore, im also pointing out that I was charged for an Extraction that I DID NOT receive.

According to Mosaic paperwork they were going to do 2 disbursements with the final being after installation completion. 
The installation company started the installation in XXXX and has not finished the installation. They were contracted to install 31 panels for the home and 6 panels for the pool and 3 batteries. They did not install the pool panels. Their install did not pass County inspection. One of the batteries needs to be replaced according to the manufacture but I must work with the installer for that. The problem I have with Mosaic is they disbursed the second wave of funds without confirming with the borrower is the work has been completed. Their justification is that the installer provided documents saying it was completed. I shared those doc has to be falified or fraudulent. I requested a copy of the documents and have not gotten a definitive response if they will share them with me. 
As it stands the installers has bailed out with XXXX with XXXX being the second disbursement and they are not returning calls, text messages nor emails. 
Mosaic has a fidicuary responsbility to ensure their borrowers are not scammed or frauded especially on actions on their part. So now the payment started in XX/XX/XXXX and I did not have panels fully installed or an operational system.

Also, on XXXX XX/XX/2022, via email, I notified the financier the system was not whole and not functioning as intended and that under no uncertain terms should the contractor receive payment. This is when the financier then altered the terms of the arraignment. Instead of exercising a modicum of due diligence and investigating my concerns, the financier released funds to the contractor anyway. Thereby putting the contractor 's interest above the consumer, this action deprived the consumer of equality in this arraignment. On several occasions, I spoke with and emailed the financier 's employees and stressed that they should do more to get the contractor out the correct my system 's issues. They did not do enough.

I must say I am very frustrated with THESE COMPANIES. I have been trying to get a loan with THEM for years. Even when I had a XXXX to XXXX XXXX XXXX, I could never get loans with you. I have been wondering for many years that maybe it's just me and maybe it's my credit. I have been going years and years with disputing things off my credit and getting my credit as high as ever. I have done everything to try to make my credit manageable, and I have still BEEN turned down for a loan every time. So now we are gon na do things my way! 

Let me inform your company of some Laws protecting consumers. 
12 cfr part 1002 talks about the Equal Credit Opportunity Act. Consumers by law can not be denied credit. By law you all can not deny me credit transactions for any applications. 
Please see the screenshots below I am a CREDIT WORTHY APPLICANT. Individual accounts can not by law deny me credit. This is DISCRIMINATION. I have many adverse action letters even from when my credit was even in the mid XXXX and I was still getting denied. So it makes me think who is responsible for this, the credit bureaus or your company.. 

Please refer to the other screenshot below. Adverse actions are illegal amongst consumers. 
Adverse action : ( ii ) does not include ( I ) information solely as to "" transactions '' or experiences between the consumer and the person furnishing the information; or ( II ) information in a consumer report. 

These are transactions that I have applied for for years and I was turned down everytime. This is {$1000.00} per violation if I pursued this towards court. 
This is 15 u.s. 1681m. Please view that as your company has broken this law and has resulted in me being denied for credit over and over. My SSN is my credit card which has been unauthorized by your company, bureaus etc. So you all can make money off my ssn but I can't benefit from credit transactions which are illegal!! Loans, Mortgage, car notes etc are extensions of credit transactions! 
There is civil liability for violation of these laws! Please see 15 usc 1692k. I posted the screenshot below I have been denied credit from you for years and I refuse to be denied again. 
Please forward this to your XXXX or corporate and have them contact me immediately! I want a loan of {$50000.00} or higher. I deserve that amount for all the years of frustration your company has caused me!!! I also want to get some credit cards to improve my credit asap! 

Please don't make me go to higher authorities and take you to court like I may soon do with the credit bureaus. If I take you to court, I have consumer rights attorneys waiting for a case like this. Keep in mind, this is {$1000.00} per violation and I have years worth of denial letters from you so you do the math Thanks!
