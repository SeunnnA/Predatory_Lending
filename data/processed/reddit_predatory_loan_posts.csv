reddit,Multiple payday loans seemingly opened in my name without my consent.,personalfinance,2025-02-01 18:38:22,"Yesterday I received dozens of texts, emails, and phone calls from multiple payday lenders saying my application has been accepted. Obviously someone got a hold of my information, but I’m not sure to what extent. The emails have my name and my email address, but I don’t know what other information may have been used. I’ve already locked my credit and set up fraud alerts on the three main credit bureaus but I’m unsure what else I need to do right now other than monitor my credit. I’m hesitant to reach out directly to any of these payday lenders, just in case there’s something a bit more nefarious happening here.

I'm reaching out because I'm feeling completely overwhelmed with my debt situation and I really don't know what to do. I’ve accumulated a significant amount of payday loan debt and cash advances, and right now, I feel like I'm in a black hole.

I enrolled in a debt consolidation program, but I'm facing some serious challenges. I can't even make my first payment because I’m late on my auto loan, and I think I need to prioritize that first. The debt consolidation company has warned me that if I miss even one payment, they might close my account, and if my debt goes to collections, they may not be able to help me anymore.

My credit is already in terrible shape, and I'm feeling hopeless. I just switched my direct deposit to a different bank to try to protect my paycheck, but I'm really confused about who I should pay first. 

I’m looking for any advice or personal experiences that could help me navigate this situation. Should I prioritize my auto loan, or is there a better approach?

reddit,Payday loan collections on an account from 2018,personalfinance,2024-11-27 23:15:09,"Hello! I got an email detailing collections on an account from 2018 through a tribal lender; the loan originated in Idaho.

reddit,Unauthorized unsigned check cleared my checking account,personalfinance,2024-12-04 04:16:51,"I rarely write checks, so when I looked at online banking this evening and saw a check for almost $200 deducted from my account, I was suspicious. The check number seemed random and not like any checks I have ever had. I was able to see a picture of the check which actually appeared to be an electronically generated fill-in-the-blank form and not an actual physical check.

The check was paid to a payday loan company I have never heard of (had to Google the name). In the signature area it had my name typed in italics along with the message ""Authorized by your customer, no original signature required, customer authenticated."" On the bottom, the MICR line shows my bank's routing number and my account number. The back of the check was blank.

This check has actually cleared and hard-posted to my account. It is obviously not a real check that I issued and signed. How should I go about reversing this transaction? Should I call my bank or the payday loan company that ""received"" and negotiated the check?

reddit,Paying off loan early whose payday am I wrecking and how bad?,personalfinance,2024-05-14 16:03:46,"How bad is it to pay off a loan early? I was a cash customer on a \~$25k purchase and the best price for a cash deal vs taking their financing was a $2000 difference. Both the salesman and the finance manager were upfront with me about being able to provide a better deal if we took their financing and asked that we made at least 9 months of payments. Sales guy was a little shady and presented us an out the door figure to me that included a non existent trade and when we sat down to finalize the deal there was an ""oops we had a trade credit so now your OTD is $x"". We stood up and started to walk out and ultimately they gave us the OTD price without the trade but the whole interaction left me with a bad taste in my mouth. The finance guy seemed to be a straight shooter he didn't waste much time trying to upsell me on stuff that I had no interest in.  
  
The interest over 9 months is only a couple hundred dollars. I wasn't to keen on taking the loan and would like to just pay it off.  If I do whose payday am I wrecking and how bad?

reddit,My Parents Want Help With Their Debt,personalfinance,2024-12-18 06:25:06,"My parents (60s) are substantially in debt (Roughly $250K) with no retirement savings.

Their income is about $170K a year with the majority ($120K) coming from my father. He had a heart attack last year, but is back to work. I am concerned that he is working himself to death over this debt. They have had substantial debt my whole life, with their last bankruptcy being in 2015.

They have two kids, myself (24, M) and sister (23, F). My sister, grandmother, and I all live under their roof. I graduated college last year. My sister dropped out of college due to health issues. They recently asked me to help out with a budget.

We went through the debt and it is roughly $250K with the majority being payday loans/credit cards/personal loans. We have two vehicles that are paid off, but both are costing more in repairs than they are worth. Minimum monthly payments on the debt, along with essentials (rent, utilities, insurance, tolls, internet, phone plan, food, gas, etc.) is approximately $12,500.00. I tried to make a budget, but it did not make any sense with their expenses exceeding income.

Their debt is compounding as they are taking out more debt to pay off previous debt.

From my perspective, they are probably going to need to declare bankruptcy again, but advised they see a professional. I am thinking that I should keep it there.

Do you all have any advice? Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thank you,

reddit,Seemingly always digging a deeper hole with no way out - advice? ,personalfinance,2024-07-25 14:17:34,"Hi there! 

I'm a newb to this community, so please forgive me if I am asking redundant questions. However, I think everyone's situation is a bit different. 

Here's my family's scenario:

- family of 4 (me, my husband, and his 2 kiddos - a 16 year old girl and 18 year old boy that is on the autism spectrum).

- I have numerous chronic health conditions that prevent me from working outside the home because each day and level of pain is different. I have filed for SSI disability in April 2023 and now I'm the queue to be processed, but my state has an average wait time of 18-24 months, routine denials and appeals, and an 86-90% denial rate. Nearly every case has to be brought before a judge for a decision - and that can take up to 3-5 years, depending on workload.

To keep my mind occupied, I went back to school to earn my bachelor's of fine arts in graphic design online. Vocational Rehabilitation covers the costs of books, tuition, supplies, materials, tuition, internet, and fuel mileage to/from all medical appointments, as well as my health insurance premium each month. While there is a LOT of paperwork and red tape to deal with using VR, I cannot complain because they have provided me EVERYTHING I need to be successful - even new MacBook pros, iPad Pro, cloud storage, software.... The list goes on. 

- My husband works as a automotive technician in a new car dealership about 35 minutes each way from home. He has been in the industry for over 25 years. His current employer and direct manager seem to be decent to work with and he likes this job so much better than the last.

HOWEVER, when he started at this current job one year ago this past February, he hired on at $25/hour with the lromoiof a review in 90 days and the possibility of raise if he produced quality, profitable work with little to no customer comebacks (customer complaints). My husband has excelled at this job because he is the most experienced in this shop of 25-30 lifts, besides the senior mainline master  mechanic. He received his raise of $1/he by June 1, 2023, placing him at $26/hr. 

But, about two months ago, his manager approached him about possibly becoming the shop foreman - watching over the other mechanics, assisting them with tasks they are not fluent or efficient with, and generally coaching the team towards better and fast completion rates, upsells, and general increase in their skill set/knowledge. 

One would think that this was an opportunity to move up - it is a supervisory position that comes with added responsibility, extra accountability, becoming lead trainer for new employees, and less time of my husband working on his own lift - and that it would come with a raise. Bot no. I'm baffled at the arrangement because he went from $26/hr to $15/he and then he makes 50¢ off of every hour the other mechanics he supervises, bills out. For example, just for my husband being at the shop from 8-5, he will make $120/day base pay. If the 4 techs under him can bill 8 hr/day each, that is a total of 32 hours x 50¢ - or $16/day in commission. That's roughly at $680/week gross paycheck. By the time taxes, insurance, retirement, etc are deducted, he might come home with a $500/week paycheck. 

Before this change in position, as a regular automotive tech, he could easily flag 38-45 hrs/week at $26hr = $1092 gross/week (based on 42 hours/week) - an average of nearly $700-725/week net.

That is a loss of about $800 per month (about $200 per week).

I should also mention that if he and his team can meet monthly quotas for upsells and accuracy percentages, he is eligible for a $500/month bonus (averages out to $125/week). Even with the monthly bonus he is still making less now than he was, though he will not listen to me. He's such a pushover when it comes to working and helping others - easily taken advantage of, maybe because when he's the martyr, he's getting that attention, praise, and ""atta boy"" that he secretly ut desperately craves. 

Otherwise, logically and mathematically, I can't make sense of the numbers. 

My husband the sole income earned for our household. Since my stepson turned 18 and is considered a legal adult (although realistically, he's 12 years old mentally and emotionally), the SSA cut his monthly disability benefits. We are currently awaiting a new case manager to assist in helping him regain those benefits and add any other possible benefits for him. 

Needless to say, our expenses each month surpass the monthly income, leaving us to bridge the gap with credit cards, and at times (against my will or consent) payday loans. I hate payday loans because the APR is 299.00% compounding. Each week, the payday loan company automatically takes half of my husband's paycheck to make that payment. 

We live in a 714 sq ft, 3 br/1 ba early 1900s bungalow with a basement. Since we rent the house, we are responsible for all utilities, trash, and yard maintenance. 

Here's our monthly breakdown;

Water/electric: ~$200.00

Natural Gas: ~60.00

Rent: $350.00 (our portion as my parents help us with the remaining $400 each month)

Groceries: ~$150.00/week

Fuel for my husband (commutes about 400 miles/week): $400.00

Fuel for my vehicle (mostly reimbursed by VR): $250.00

Streaming services (we do not have cable or satellite TV) ~$75.00

Monthly vehicle maintenance: ~$25/mo unless an emergency repair pops up

Vehicle insurance: ~$170.00

Household insurance (renter's insurance) ~$30.00

CCLI insurance for my husband and me: ~$30.00

Vehicle extended warranty/service plan (husband's vehicle): $150.00

2 vehicle loan payments: $1,276.00

Internet service (reimbursed by VR): $89.99

Health insurance premium (me only): ~$70.00 (reimbursed by VR)

Credit card payments: ~$1,050.00 (~$40,000 credit card debt + accruing interest averaging 25%)

Payday Loan: ~350.00 (+200.00% APR - original loan amount was $1,350.00 - current balance with interest as of today - $1,754.13, even after $675.00 in payments so far)

Monthly subscriptions used for school (cloud storage, reference sites, stock art, etc.):  ~$80.00 (reimbursed by VR)

Medical bill payments: ~30.00

Trash service: $60.50 every 3 months (~$20.17/mo)

Cell phone service: ~$200.00 for 2 lines and phones 

Husband insists on eating out every day at lunch during the week: $400.00

Entertainment/Dining Out together: ~$250.00

Pet care/supplies/food: $175 every 6 weeks

--------
Total monthly outflow: ~$6,000-7,000

Husband's income: ~$2,400.00
Monthly Bonus (if earned): $500.00
Monthly VR reimbursement: ~$740.00
Pet sitting side hustle (not reliable or steady) - Average of ~$60/mo +/-

TOTAL INCOME: ~$3,860.00

Overbudget: ~ $2140.00-3140.00

This is a crisis. 

I know the credit card debit, vehicle payments, payday loan and the cut in my husband's salary, and my physical inability to work because of my health are the pain points. However I am overwhelmed and at a loss as to how to even make and balance a budget with this much disparagement. 

I've thought about making an appointment with either financial planner or debt counselor to see if they can help me work out a plan. My state offers a free service for debt counseling. I met with them once and their only solution was bankruptcy, which I couldn't even afford to pay for. 

We are in our mid-to-lats 40s and really do not want to do bankruptcy as we have a dream to build a home on part of my parent's acreage in the country. Currently, our credit scores are around the 615-625 mark and we are utilizing 51-56% of our credit (keeping the credit score low due to the debt ratio).

I know this is a long shot, but does anyone have any legitimate suggestions or resources to make a plan and then this situation around? I am sick of the daily stress. DCF claims that we make too much each month - the calculate off of the gross income, although no one lives off their gross income - so we are not eligible for SNAP or LIHEAP (utility assistance program) assistance.

My husband refuses to discuss our finances - I think mostly because he knows we're in so deep and it feels like the weight of it is all on his shoulders, that he's not doing s good enough job, etc. He does like to bury and avoid issues. So frustrating. 

Any logistical help would be appreciated - resources, software for planning, etc

I pay $250/month in credit card minimums and $700/month for the loans (and the balances aren't getting any smaller.) I make $17/hr making $522/week and I pay $975/month for rent and $100/month for internet. All other bills are covered by my partner, but I get my own gas which is about $240/month. 

Already we're at $2165/month in expenses while only making $2088/month. I don't have any savings. Sometimes I doordash, but it's often not available in my area when I'm not working, or my partner wants to spend time with me after work and kinda doesn't let me go out and doordash and they're always saying there are drunk drivers and crazies on the road when DD is available in my area. I've already also sold everything of any value to my name to pay off this debt and only made a $600 dent which got filled back in by interest. 

I just want to get my crap together and get this paid off, but it feels impossible. I don't have a degree, my last job fired me in the middle of my apprenticeship because the place was having money problems, and anything I do to try to make money just ends up costing me way more. And I don't have any support from my partner because they're right, it was my own actions that got me into this spot and they don't make much more than I do. 

I've been told to just ignore all my CC minimums while I get the lower balances paid off first, but I'm worried that it could ruin my dad's credit too since he cosigned on my first credit card that has the highest debt. 
And I haven't even touched my medical debt. I'm scared to know how much is there.

reddit,Which advisor/consultant/coach do I need for my potential paycheck to paycheck life?,personalfinance,2025-04-14 22:23:21,"Looking for some advice on who to contact. Financial coach, financial planner (that’s all I can think of right now)?

SHORT Version:

I need a person to look over my very detailed budget and see if my spending/savings is justified. Am I saving too much or am I truly living paycheck to paycheck?

EDIT: Determined I'm not living paycheck to paycheck, but my anxiety has me feel like living that way. 

LONG version:

**I don’t (think) I have a spending issue, in reality I feel I have a to much savings issue (cheap ass).** Combined income into 6 figures with 4 kids, all which have 529 (while not large, they have money contributing into them), Maxed out work 401k, IRA that I sometimes contribute to (when market goes down), wife has 401 she is putting into, HSA that we max out,  Emergency fund of 10 months, savings fund, vacation fund, small cash fund, Mortgage payment that paying down early (2 payments extra a year), 1 vehicle loan with 1 yr left and 0% interest on a mower for 2 more yrs, no credit card debt.

I feel like all I do is save and feel like I have no money to splurge. Our checks go into our checking and then gets automatically divided into those savings accounts. At the end of the day, we have just the right amount to pay all the bills and the process starts over on payday. If there is extra at the end of the week, I will move it to savings. I am not afraid to use the savings, but try my hardest not to touch it. I bought a new gaming laptop for $900, but very quickly replenished savings

When the 6 of us go out to eat and spend $75 I feel sick for spending that much (even though that is on the cheap side of it). When the kids need new shoes, I feel sick spending more than $50. We all get haircuts at great clips at the same time, that is $75 which hurts when I pay that.  I would like to buy new shoes, but don’t want to spend $75 for new ones even thought 1.5 yrs ago I bought new $150 running shoes.  I hate paying full price for anything and will skimp on everything if given the option. My wife love to thrift shop for clothes (more “fancier” places than goodwill but still second hand). Will buy expensive gifts on Marketplace given the chance. Example, my son wanted to learn piano so for a birthday present we picked up a used (not a kiddy one) Yamaha Keyboard and lessons. We set it up with a bow and said happy birthday (along with other gifts he opened). Had we bought a new keyboard, he would have gotten the enjoyment of opening a large gift and the joy of setting it up (saved us $300).

Instead of doing a crazy vacation (cruise, all inclusive, Disney), my wife wants to go to Mt Rushmore. We have driven to FL (1000 miles one way) to save money instead of flying the 6 of use and getting a rental car down there (saved us $4000). For our trip to Mt. Rushmore coming up, we need to rent a vehicle because we are flying into DEN (to see family for a few days) and then driving. We are using Turo instead of renting from a rental service (saves us $1500). Flight is all paid for from points.

Any projects that need done, I do them all. Install a pool, build a deck, install new hvac, build a barn, install subpanel, etc. I did pay for someone to replace my garage spring (not trying to tackle that).

I have every expense calculated, from gas, groceries, fast food/eat out, animal expense, kids instrument lesson/rentals, etc…

**Or am I one of those people that are living paycheck to paycheck with 6 figure income, but also putting into savings. I feel like I couldn’t afford another big expense if I wanted!**",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1jzbsqb/which_advisorconsultantcoach_do_i_need_for_my/,predatory
reddit,Freed Myself from Payday Apps,personalfinance,2025-03-13 07:49:23,"I’ve been in a bloody cycle for about 4 years with payday apps. Dave, Empower, Brigit, you name it. It was so stressful! My credit score was mid 500s (I know) and through diligently being a no-life* and bunkering down at home for a few months, my credit score reached 600 even. I’ve gotten approved for a secured credit card and put aside $500 from my paycheck to deposit into it. 

It was a rough pay period where I effectively had no money while the card was being processed, but now that my payday apps are paid off and now having a credit card that actually reports, things are looking up :) I’ve been hustling at work and school, and finally made a deposit into my savings after it being DRY for years. 

Hopefully I can continue on this upward trend— only using my credit card for essential things whilst putting something in my savings. I’m very happy but very nervous. Nervous because I feel like I’m still very far from being as financially stable or independent as I’d like to be. I’m hoping to save up for a down payment on a vehicle by next month as I haven’t had a car for a few months**

*I’d still go out with friends and such! Whereas I used to go out a few times a week, I’ve only been going out once a week or once every other week. It was a real adjustment, actually. Got kinda depressed not seeing people as often as I’d used to. The extra time spent at home, I’ve dedicated to bettering myself. Been reading a lot more, studying for my classes and just chillin. It can lowkey be boring sometimes ngl but I know itll be worth it. 

**This is what makes me REALLY nervous tbh. My family is willing to help with the down payment, thankfully. Any advice on car finances? Insurance, loans, etc?

I hope at least my story can inspire some of you :)",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1ja6svr/freed_myself_from_payday_apps/,predatory
