reddit,Multiple payday loans seemingly opened in my name without my consent.,personalfinance,2025-02-01 18:38:22,"Yesterday I received dozens of texts, emails, and phone calls from multiple payday lenders saying my application has been accepted. Obviously someone got a hold of my information, but I’m not sure to what extent. The emails have my name and my email address, but I don’t know what other information may have been used. I’ve already locked my credit and set up fraud alerts on the three main credit bureaus but I’m unsure what else I need to do right now other than monitor my credit. I’m hesitant to reach out directly to any of these payday lenders, just in case there’s something a bit more nefarious happening here.  Any suggestions?

I was a cash customer on a \~$25k purchase and the best price for a cash deal vs taking their financing was a $2000 difference. Both the salesman and the finance manager were upfront with me about being able to provide a better deal if we took their financing and asked that we made at least 9 months of payments. Sales guy was a little shady and presented us an out the door figure to me that included a non existent trade and when we sat down to finalize the deal there was an ""oops we had a trade credit so now your OTD is $x"". We stood up and started to walk out and ultimately they gave us the OTD price without the trade but the whole interaction left me with a bad taste in my mouth. The finance guy seemed to be a straight shooter he didn't waste much time trying to upsell me on stuff that I had no interest in.      The interest over 9 months is only a couple hundred dollars. I wasn't to keen on taking the loan and would like to just pay it off.

reddit,My Parents Want Help With Their Debt,personalfinance,2024-12-18 06:25:06,"My parents (60s) are substantially in debt (Roughly $250K) with no retirement savings.  Their income is about $170K a year with the majority ($120K) coming from my father. He had a heart attack last year, but is back to work. I am concerned that he is working himself to death over this debt. They have had substantial debt my whole life, with their last bankruptcy being in 2015.  They have two kids, myself (24, M) and sister (23, F). My sister, grandmother, and I all live under their roof. I graduated college last year. My sister dropped out of college due to health issues. They recently asked me to help out with a budget.  We went through the debt and it is roughly $250K with the majority being payday loans/credit cards/personal loans. We have two vehicles that are paid off, but both are costing more in repairs than they are worth. Minimum monthly payments on the debt, along with essentials (rent, utilities, insurance, tolls, internet, phone plan, food, gas, etc.) is approximately $12,500.00. I tried to make a budget, but it did not make any sense with their expenses exceeding income.  Their debt is compounding as they are taking out more debt to pay off previous debt.  From my perspective, they are probably going to need to declare bankruptcy again, but advised they see a professional. I am thinking that I should keep it there.  Do you all have any advice? Please let me know if you have any questions.  Thank you,  \*\*For Context - I am making $70K/year, have $20K in federal student loans, $30K as an emergency fund, and $10K in my 401K. No other debt.

reddit,Seemingly always digging a deeper hole with no way out - advice? ,personalfinance,2024-07-25 14:17:34,"Hi there!   I'm a newb to this community, so please forgive me if I am asking redundant questions. However, I think everyone's situation is a bit different.   Here's my family's scenario:  - family of 4 (me, my husband, and his 2 kiddos - a 16 year old girl and 18 year old boy that is on the autism spectrum).  - I have numerous chronic health conditions that prevent me from working outside the home because each day and level of pain is different. I have filed for SSI disability in April 2023 and now I'm the queue to be processed, but my state has an average wait time of 18-24 months, routine denials and appeals, and an 86-90% denial rate. Nearly every case has to be brought before a judge for a decision - and that can take up to 3-5 years, depending on workload.  To keep my mind occupied, I went back to school to earn my bachelor's of fine arts in graphic design online. Vocational Rehabilitation covers the costs of books, tuition, supplies, materials, tuition, internet, and fuel mileage to/from all medical appointments, as well as my health insurance premium each month. While there is a LOT of paperwork and red tape to deal with using VR, I cannot complain because they have provided me EVERYTHING I need to be successful - even new MacBook pros, iPad Pro, cloud storage, software.... The list goes on.   - My husband works as a automotive technician in a new car dealership about 35 minutes each way from home. He has been in the industry for over 25 years. His current employer and direct manager seem to be decent to work with and he likes this job so much better than the last.  HOWEVER, when he started at this current job one year ago this past February, he hired on at $25/hour with the lromoiof a review in 90 days and the possibility of raise if he produced quality, profitable work with little to no customer comebacks (customer complaints). My husband has excelled at this job because he is the most experienced in this shop of 25-30 lifts, besides the senior mainline master  mechanic. He received his raise of $1/he by June 1, 2023, placing him at $26/hr.   But, about two months ago, his manager approached him about possibly becoming the shop foreman - watching over the other mechanics, assisting them with tasks they are not fluent or efficient with, and generally coaching the team towards better and fast completion rates, upsells, and general increase in their skill set/knowledge.   One would think that this was an opportunity to move up - it is a supervisory position that comes with added responsibility, extra accountability, becoming lead trainer for new employees, and less time of my husband working on his own lift - and that it would come with a raise. Bot no. I'm baffled at the arrangement because he went from $26/hr to $15/he and then he makes 50¢ off of every hour the other mechanics he supervises, bills out. For example, just for my husband being at the shop from 8-5, he will make $120/day base pay. If the 4 techs under him can bill 8 hr/day each, that is a total of 32 hours x 50¢ - or $16/day in commission. That's roughly at $680/week gross paycheck. By the time taxes, insurance, retirement, etc are deducted, he might come home with a $500/week paycheck.   Before this change in position, as a regular automotive tech, he could easily flag 38-45 hrs/week at $26hr = $1092 gross/week (based on 42 hours/week) - an average of nearly $700-725/week net.  That is a loss of about $800 per month (about $200 per week).  I should also mention that if he and his team can meet monthly quotas for upsells and accuracy percentages, he is eligible for a $500/month bonus (averages out to $125/week). Even with the monthly bonus he is still making less now than he was, though he will not listen to me. He's such a pushover when it comes to working and helping others - easily taken advantage of, maybe because when he's the martyr, he's getting that attention, praise, and ""atta boy"" that he secretly ut desperately craves.   Otherwise, logically and mathematically, I can't make sense of the numbers.   My husband the sole income earned for our household. Since my stepson turned 18 and is considered a legal adult (although realistically, he's 12 years old mentally and emotionally), the SSA cut his monthly disability benefits. We are currently awaiting a new case manager to assist in helping him regain those benefits and add any other possible benefits for him.   Needless to say, our expenses each month surpass the monthly income, leaving us to bridge the gap with credit cards, and at times (against my will or consent) payday loans. I hate payday loans because the APR is 299.00% compounding. Each week, the payday loan company automatically takes half of my husband's paycheck to make that payment.   We live in a 714 sq ft, 3 br/1 ba early 1900s bungalow with a basement. Since we rent the house, we are responsible for all utilities, trash, and yard maintenance.   Here's our monthly breakdown;  Water/electric: ~$200.00  Natural Gas: ~60.00  Rent: $350.00 (our portion as my parents help us with the remaining $400 each month)  Groceries: ~$150.00/week  Fuel for my husband (commutes about 400 miles/week): $400.00  Fuel for my vehicle (mostly reimbursed by VR): $250.00  Streaming services (we do not have cable or satellite TV) ~$75.00  Monthly vehicle maintenance: ~$25/mo unless an emergency repair pops up  Vehicle insurance: ~$170.00  Household insurance (renter's insurance) ~$30.00  CCLI insurance for my husband and me: ~$30.00  Vehicle extended warranty/service plan (husband's vehicle): $150.00  2 vehicle loan payments: $1,276.00  Internet service (reimbursed by VR): $89.99  Health insurance premium (me only): ~$70.00 (reimbursed by VR)  Credit card payments: ~$1,050.00 (~$40,000 credit card debt + accruing interest averaging 25%)  Payday Loan: ~350.00 (+200.00% APR - original loan amount was $1,350.00 - current balance with interest as of today - $1,754.13, even after $675.00 in payments so far)  Monthly subscriptions used for school (cloud storage, reference sites, stock art, etc.):  ~$80.00 (reimbursed by VR)  Medical bill payments: ~30.00  Trash service: $60.50 every 3 months (~$20.17/mo)  Cell phone service: ~$200.00 for 2 lines and phones   Husband insists on eating out every day at lunch during the week: $400.00  Entertainment/Dining Out together: ~$250.00  Pet care/supplies/food: $175 every 6 weeks  -------- Total monthly outflow: ~$6,000-7,000  Husband's income: ~$2,400.00 Monthly Bonus (if earned): $500.00 Monthly VR reimbursement: ~$740.00 Pet sitting side hustle (not reliable or steady) - Average of ~$60/mo +/-  TOTAL INCOME: ~$3,860.00  Overbudget: ~ $2140.00-3140.00  This is a crisis.   I know the credit card debit, vehicle payments, payday loan and the cut in my husband's salary, and my physical inability to work because of my health are the pain points. However I am overwhelmed and at a loss as to how to even make and balance a budget with this much disparagement.   I've thought about making an appointment with either financial planner or debt counselor to see if they can help me work out a plan. My state offers a free service for debt counseling. I met with them once and their only solution was bankruptcy, which I couldn't even afford to pay for.   We are in our mid-to-lats 40s and really do not want to do bankruptcy as we have a dream to build a home on part of my parent's acreage in the country. Currently, our credit scores are around the 615-625 mark and we are utilizing 51-56% of our credit (keeping the credit score low due to the debt ratio).  I know this is a long shot, but does anyone have any legitimate suggestions or resources to make a plan and then this situation around? I am sick of the daily stress. DCF claims that we make too much each month - the calculate off of the gross income, although no one lives off their gross income - so we are not eligible for SNAP or LIHEAP (utility assistance program) assistance.  My husband refuses to discuss our finances - I think mostly because he knows we're in so deep and it feels like the weight of it is all on his shoulders, that he's not doing s good enough job, etc. He does like to bury and avoid issues. So frustrating.   Any logistical help would be appreciated - resources, software for planning, etc   Thank you. :)",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1ebw0p3/seemingly_always_digging_a_deeper_hole_with_no/,predatory

Financial coach, financial planner (that’s all I can think of right now)?  SHORT Version:  I need a person to look over my very detailed budget and see if my spending/savings is justified. Am I saving too much or am I truly living paycheck to paycheck?  EDIT: Determined I'm not living paycheck to paycheck, but my anxiety has me feel like living that way.   LONG version:  **I don’t (think) I have a spending issue, in reality I feel I have a to much savings issue (cheap ass).** Combined income into 6 figures with 4 kids, all which have 529 (while not large, they have money contributing into them), Maxed out work 401k, IRA that I sometimes contribute to (when market goes down), wife has 401 she is putting into, HSA that we max out,  Emergency fund of 10 months, savings fund, vacation fund, small cash fund, Mortgage payment that paying down early (2 payments extra a year), 1 vehicle loan with 1 yr left and 0% interest on a mower for 2 more yrs, no credit card debt.  I feel like all I do is save and feel like I have no money to splurge. Our checks go into our checking and then gets automatically divided into those savings accounts. At the end of the day, we have just the right amount to pay all the bills and the process starts over on payday. If there is extra at the end of the week, I will move it to savings. I am not afraid to use the savings, but try my hardest not to touch it. I bought a new gaming laptop for $900, but very quickly replenished savings  When the 6 of us go out to eat and spend $75 I feel sick for spending that much (even though that is on the cheap side of it). When the kids need new shoes, I feel sick spending more than $50. We all get haircuts at great clips at the same time, that is $75 which hurts when I pay that.  I would like to buy new shoes, but don’t want to spend $75 for new ones even thought 1.5 yrs ago I bought new $150 running shoes.  I hate paying full price for anything and will skimp on everything if given the option. My wife love to thrift shop for clothes (more “fancier” places than goodwill but still second hand). Will buy expensive gifts on Marketplace given the chance. Example, my son wanted to learn piano so for a birthday present we picked up a used (not a kiddy one) Yamaha Keyboard and lessons. We set it up with a bow and said happy birthday (along with other gifts he opened). Had we bought a new keyboard, he would have gotten the enjoyment of opening a large gift and the joy of setting it up (saved us $300).  Instead of doing a crazy vacation (cruise, all inclusive, Disney), my wife wants to go to Mt Rushmore. We have driven to FL (1000 miles one way) to save money instead of flying the 6 of use and getting a rental car down there (saved us $4000). For our trip to Mt. Rushmore coming up, we need to rent a vehicle because we are flying into DEN (to see family for a few days) and then driving. We are using Turo instead of renting from a rental service (saves us $1500). Flight is all paid for from points.  Any projects that need done, I do them all. Install a pool, build a deck, install new hvac, build a barn, install subpanel, etc. I did pay for someone to replace my garage spring (not trying to tackle that).  I have every expense calculated, from gas, groceries, fast food/eat out, animal expense, kids instrument lesson/rentals, etc…  **Or am I one of those people that are living paycheck to paycheck with 6 figure income, but also putting into savings.

My credit score was mid 500s (I know) and through diligently being a no-life* and bunkering down at home for a few months, my credit score reached 600 even. I’ve gotten approved for a secured credit card and put aside $500 from my paycheck to deposit into it.   It was a rough pay period where I effectively had no money while the card was being processed, but now that my payday apps are paid off and now having a credit card that actually reports, things are looking up :) I’ve been hustling at work and school, and finally made a deposit into my savings after it being DRY for years.   Hopefully I can continue on this upward trend— only using my credit card for essential things whilst putting something in my savings. I’m very happy but very nervous. Nervous because I feel like I’m still very far from being as financially stable or independent as I’d like to be. I’m hoping to save up for a down payment on a vehicle by next month as I haven’t had a car for a few months**  *I’d still go out with friends and such! Whereas I used to go out a few times a week, I’ve only been going out once a week or once every other week. It was a real adjustment, actually. Got kinda depressed not seeing people as often as I’d used to. The extra time spent at home, I’ve dedicated to bettering myself. Been reading a lot more, studying for my classes and just chillin.

reddit,"Decent income, still struggling",personalfinance,2024-06-04 16:31:36,"100k household, living like we’re poor  Hello, Posting here in hopes of getting some advice from people that have experienced something similar. Obligatory apology for formatting, I’m on mobile.  My wife and I both work full time, paid $2,634.14 biweekly and our household income is 100k before taxes, after takes I believe it’s roughly 92,000- give or take. Last September we filed for bankruptcy as a result of poor planning and decision making/ things happening out of our control (which, admittedly would not have been as big of an issue if the planning and decision making was better).  For what feels like forever, my wife and I have been living paycheck to paycheck, and that’s certainly an understatement considering tomorrows payday and we have about 2 dollars left in our bank account.  For our monthly expenses, we are currently paying: $400 for our car, $100ish bucks for car insurance, $130 for cellphones, I’d say around $100 for subscriptions( probably less but for numbers sake, it’s probably close enough) ETA: 100 might be high, but I can update this once I am able to look through everything and get an accurate number, our mortgage is going up to $1,000 in July, our utility bills are around $350/ month ,and we will be paying $900/month for 2 kids in child care, (it’s typically 500 a month but they’re both going full time in the summer) we have a pre-tax childcare cost account, and we get $258 bi-weekly (Should be $208). Now that I have laid all of that out, it’s really embarrassing how much we are struggling.  ETA: we spend about $1000 a month on food and household items, around $150 for gas, we have very good health insurance that’s affordable and covers most things and anything out of pocket is paid for by our HSA.  Internet is $65/ month. We hardly go out to eat because of dietary restrictions and neither of us smoke or drink  A while ago we were in a pinch for money due to needing to deal with a household emergency so we used the app Earnin and this is where things started to get pretty bad because we haven’t been able to stop since and it absolutely annihilates our paycheck when it comes time to pay it back+ fees.  How the hell do we get out of this cycle? We are still paying bills late, getting disconnection notices, and overall struggling to live. We have cut back on our unnecessary spending and have been putting effort into bringing lunch to work/ if we know we’re going to be out of the house running errands around meal times. Do we just stop using Earnin and deal with it that way, let bills be late so we’re not just constantly stealing money from our next paycheck?  Sorry if this is not cohesive, I’m burned the hell out from stress. Ask any questions and I appreciate any advice.  ETA: Hi All,  I have looked at my bank statements and looked at my subscription services and I was wrong about $100, but not by a whole lot. (YIKES) It came out to being $82.36, so we're gonna go ahead start swinging the axe and start canceling them. I also got a few of my numbers wrong in the original post so I apologize about that.  I was also very wrong about the amount that Earnin takes back from our pay check. I did not state it in my orignal post but in a comment I said that it was like $450 + fees each week. It's not a loan that I owe money on, it's an ""advance"" on my paycheck and then on pay day it comes out automatically. Well, tomorrow is pay day and it's taking a whopping $731.43 right off the top off of our paycheck. Tomorrow will be less of a paycheck than what we're used to, only by roughly $55 bucks but still. My wife had to miss time at work due to an on going crisis with a family member, whom she is trying to obtain guardianship of.  Tomorrow we will be paid $2,579.19 + the $208.33 Child Care Reimbursement (I said it was $258 in my original post). My wife is also supposed to get $75 a week in Child Support but it never consistent, she did not get the full amount last week and we are not expecting to get any tomorrow. (This just seem to be the pattern of the Child Support Enforcement office) So with $2,787.52 this is what we have to pay now, and this isn't even counting gas and groceries yet. I will edit this post to include all of the monthly expenses tomorrow, but it's past 10pm where I am and I have to go to bed.  * Earnin Repayment: $731.43 * May Mortgage: $803.00 * May Car: $403.00 * Water: $100 * Daycare: $200 * Electric: $140.47 * Netflix: $15.49 * Amazon+: 14.99 * CBS: $6.32 * Guardianship Costs: $100After all of this, I figured I'll have $272.82 left.

I’ve just started budgeting a few months ago after realizing I wasn’t saving enough for long-term success.   My budget is based off of two Bi-weekly paychecks. While living very frugally, paying my normal monthly expenses, contributing 12% to my 401k/Roth, investing $150 ETF and saving an additional $250/month, I usually just about break even each month.   In May, I am looking forward to a 3 pay cycle month, which means I will have an additional ~2,000 (after deducting 401k and automatic $200 savings). What is the best way to use this additional money?   Additional info:  Monthly living expenses are ~3,250/month in the winter, but lower when not paying for heat. Edit: This includes mortgage, car payments, sinking funds, in addition to gas/electric/groceries, etc.   I have 6k left on a car loan. Currently paying $700/month to accelerate paying it off. I’m considering using some of the 2k towards this acceleration.   I have a fully funded 6-month emergency fund in a HYSA. My additional $250 savings per month are automatically deposited here.

reddit,Earnin Took $912 From My Husband's Bank Account Unauthorized,personalfinance,2024-07-04 05:58:59,"EDITED FOR UPDATE   Last update at the bottom! Today is 8/14/24    Basically the title but worse. My husband had an Earnin account that has been closed for 2 months. He got paid today, and Earnin had taken $912 from his account somehow. Now we are in the negative. Obviously this is unauthorized, and doesn't even make sense. He went back and forth with Earnin and the bank all day. The bank initially said that we would have to wait until the charge wasn't pending and then dispute it, then they said that it would be fixed by the end of the business day. It was not fixed, our account is still negative. Earnin had no explanation for any of this apparently. Of course this happened the day before the 4th of July, so we can't do anything until Friday. We have filed complaints with the FDIC for the bank and the BBB for both Earnin and the bank, but what else can we do? How is this happening? I hope this never happens to anyone else because it is insanely stressful. I want to see if we can file a police report, though I do not think we can for this. I am pregnant and we have pets. People have bills. Any advice or info is appreciated. Thanks in advance.  Edit for update the next day:     Transactions were posted and disputed. I am not sure if everyone who commented on this post understood the situation, but it is a lot to reply to everyone lol. Not sure if everyone will even see this update but oh well. We were back and forth on the phone with the bank and Earnin for hours. Some conversations took place over online support chats, most were over phone. The bank didn’t seem to care until there was mention of the FDIC or the BBB. I understand contacting them, especially the FDIC was probably useless, but I feel as though contacting the BBB was necessary at least for Earnin.    Our whole issue was that the bank said it would be fixed by the end of their business day yesterday, and it wasn’t fixed. Filing disputes immediately cancelled the card the disputes were associated with. We are still closing the account and going to a credit until when banks open tomorrow. The bank could have, and should have, said there was nothing they could do instead of saying it was going to be fixed.  People live paycheck to paycheck nowadays. I just wanted to get groceries yesterday lol, but we will survive.    I really don’t recommend anyone use the Earnin service, or if you do, immediately tell your bank to put in a stop order of payment afterwards. I cannot imagine this happening to someone and their electric happened to get shut off for 2 days because of it, that is horrific. Luckily, one of our bills bounced, which we will have to figure out, and I ate taco bell last night. Could have been worse. Thanks for everyone who commented, even those who may not have been the kindest lol. It is all good. This would not have happened had we somehow known ahead of time to put a stop order of payment on a closed payday loan account.    Hope this never happens to anyone again, and I hope the complaints we filed with the BBB and CFPB about Earnin do something.    One more update as I am a little tired of these comments related to the BBB lol: I am aware that we shouldn’t have filed a complaint to the BBB about the bank, however it doesn’t negatively or positively impact us no matter the outcome really. It may just annoy the bank, which won’t matter since we are closing our accounts with them anyways. Again, I just hope this never happens to anyone else. Other people I am sure would know even less of what to do than us, not saying we did exactly the right thing, but still. Financial literacy doesn’t seem like a skill everyone has unfortunately. On the flip side, I am sure some would know exactly what to do lol, and that is really good for whoever that would be. In the future, we are never using companies like this again, and I do not recommend anyone using them ever.    8/14 update!  The bank resolved the disputes within about a week. Filing a complaint with the CFPB was a great idea, so thank you so much to the people who commented that! We did that a few weeks ago, Earnin gave us $912, probably to avoid a potential lawsuit. It felt unreal at the time, we were so happy lol. I highly recommend anyone doing that with bad businesses and in situations like this!! Thank you to everyone who has read this post. I really hope when people google “Earnin took my money” and similar things like I was that this post comes up, because I was having basically no helpful results. Hopefully this doesn’t happen to anyone, but if it does file a complaint with the CFPB (Consumer Financial Protection Bureau)!!!

I've always struggled with finances but the last year things have gotten a little out of hand. I've lived on my own since I was 16 and I've never really had any support from my family so I started out adulthood needing loans. I've never collected welfare and have always worked for my money, I know it doesn't overly matter I just like people to know i don't abuse the system. It was fine until I moved to a new town and started my new job, I had to take out some payday loans to cover my basics and now I'm in an endless cycle of paying my loans just to reapply for them so I can continue to pay my bills. I'm trying really hard to get out of the cycle but everytime I get close something happens and I'm right back where I started. It's to the point where I pay back all my loans when I get paid and have no money and have to redo it. My car payment is expensive and so is my insurance, plus I have rent gas groceries my phone and that's it. I don't pay for streaming services or anything luxurious, at this point I can barely even afford the gas in my car. I'm drowning and I don't know how to get out. I can only do so much overtime at work ontop of my regularly scheduled overtime. I just need help, I can't budget when I have all these loans but I can't get out of the loans when my payments are so high. I spend so much time stressing over money I don't even enjoy my life. It's just a constant struggle. So on a normal pay without overtime I make around 2300bi weekly, so 4600 monthly. my rent and utilities average 1300-1400, my phone bill around 100, my car payments are 300 biweekly and my insurance is 400. Gas and groceries can vary but id guess around 400-600 monthly.  The loans i pay biweekly are a little more than what I thought when I answered in a comment, so one is 570, another is 490, 350, 2 for 150 and 2 for 100 so my bills and my loans come out to around 4600 which is what i make in a month but it obviously doesn't all come out at once, the loans all come out biweekly as do my car payments and the rest are just once a month my rent on the first and my insurance on the 17th.

I know I'm doing well financially, but I feel I need an external review on how I'm balancing my savings contributions.  I completely phased out of normal Roth IRA contributions last year, and my current non-retirement goal is saving for a down payment on a house. I'm taking advantage of most tax-advantage savings (maxing backdoor Roth, 401k personal contributions (no mega backdoor), and HSA) and everything else not being spent goes to savings. No current debt (car, student loans, etc. paid off as of last year), and I keep my CCs paid in full each month.  Right now, everything savings-wise goes to my HYSA, earning 4%+ (depending on their mood). My savings goal for the house is a down payment (at least 20% for no PMI) and 6-12 months of mortgage (incl. tax, etc.). I'm about ½ way to this goal, but now I'm thinking about if I'm robbing a bit from the near future for this. Even though it would be in taxable accounts, should I be getting some money into the market (3-fund portfolio) for mid-term expenses and growth?  While I'm concerned about the market now (you can guess why), this would be for 5+ years down the road, meaning short term volatility isn't as impactful. Of course, you need decades for the volatility's importance to truly be diminished, but that's also why I'd be doing payday contributions to ease the semi-shorter term aspect.  From my calcs so far, I'm set to reach the house goal by early-mid next year. This would be using the HYSA savings. I'd say my risk tolerance is relatively high except for the house savings since I'm thinking long term. Doing an 80/20 split of house/investment savings would delay me 4-6 months, but I've also heard that just looking for and finalizing a house purchase can easily take that long.  Thanks for reading this far, and I'm looking forward to hearing whatever insight people share!   Tl;dr: Saving to start searching and buy house in ~12 months.

I enrolled in the Beyond Finance program last year, because it seemed like a slightly better option than bankruptcy. Things went pretty well, some of my accounts have been settled and paid off, including a very predatory payday loan.   My largest creditor, Discover, sued me while Beyond Finance was already negotiating with them. I was served, and I was able to file an answer with the help of an attorney through my Employee Assistance Program at work. The attorney found some technical errors that will complicate the court process for Discover.  Yesterday I finally received a resolution offer from Discover through Beyond Finance. But they are requiring very high monthly payments for 12 months. In order to do that, my monthly payment to Beyond Finance would have to increase by $225, plus they need me to deposit a lump sum of $500 within a week. If I comply, they will stop court proceedings.   There is no way I can afford this offer. It would lead to bankruptcy, which was what I was trying to avoid. It also wouldn't leave any additional funds to put towards paying other creditors. I am considering making a counter offer that would spread payments over 2 years instead of 1. But I am very scared that they will just get a judgment against me if I don't agree to their impossible terms.   I have also considered withdrawing from Beyond Finance and finding a different way to resolve my debts, but I feel like I am in too far already. The program seems to work mostly, but this big creditor is a big hurdle. At this point, my credit is destroyed, which I knew would happen. This makes it impossible to qualify for any kind of debt consolidation.   I would appreciate any advice or experiences with negotiating a debt that is already in court. I know it is my debt and I want to pay, but I can't pay as quickly as they are demanding. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1emdw6y/beyond_finance_sued_by_creditor/,predatory
reddit,Proof of debt ownership,personalfinance,2025-03-10 22:58:57,Hi all. I seen this company advertised about challenging the banks about proof of ownership of your debt. I got talking to them on the phone and they explained that they act as a middleman between myself and the bank (payday loan) and basically challenge them to prove they still own my debt (loan). He said my debt will be renegotiated with another lender for a lower percentage and I will need to stop paying my current loan immediately while negotiations are taking place.

Apparently those plans aren’t common now.  I’d forgotten about it due to life stuff till Mom mentioned it the other day and I’m like, I’ll call and see what money is there.  Turns out I have over 50K, is fully vested so I could take it as monthly pension payments or roll the whole thing into whatever investment account I’d like. My retirement accounts are all at Fidelity: in total from all the 401Ks I’ve had in my working life I have about 120K.  I texted Sis privately and she mentioned if I took the cash now there would be big penalties and a 10% tax so I’d either have to a)take cash and ask for taxes to be taken out, but you’d have to take more than you want to cover that or b) take the cash and be prepared For a massive tax bill next year.  After my recent awful interstate move I currently owe around 20K on two credit cards and a payday loan and an emergency loan of 3900 from my mothers credit card.  I paid Mom one loan installment of 200, and if all I can do (on top of having to support myself in a new city and make monthly payments of some kind toward all the debt) is that it will take like 3 years to pay Mom back.

I got my first autoloan in June of this year, with payments starting in July. I read through the contract about payments and all it says is that the full bill must be paid every month, and any late balance must be paid in full within 10 days.  For July I paid the whole bill all at once, and everything was fine. After that I set up a reoccurring auto-pay to come out every payday for a bit over half of what I owe each month. For August this resulted in three payments due to how things lined up, and in September this was two payments.  This last Friday I received notice that I was late on my bill and a late fee was applied. I checked payment history and both September payments went through without issue, so I raised a ticket with support. I am being told now that it's because there was no note on my account that I would be making split payments.  I reviewed my contract once more, and there is no mention of pre-authorization needed for split payments at all. I brought this up to them and the official response was, ""This is not something in your contract, this is how things are processed on our end."". Please note that no late fee was applied for August where I also made split payments.   There is no mention of this anywhere that I can find, and now they are claiming I still owe for this entire month after I made a payment already since that was covering my ""late"" balance from September.  This is my only loan that has ever worked like that and I'm just confused how that even makes sense. If the full bill is being paid every month, and they even accepted split payments in August without a late fee, how can it be justified that September was late?  Is there something I should ask or say to them about this, as I'm genuinely at a loss as to what to do.

I have been kicked out of home about 3 months ago and spent a full 2 months homeless while paying $125 a week for loans/phone payments  Was making about $700 a week at my first job and another $300 a week on my second (after tax)  About a month ago I finally got my own place and my work has been fully aware of my living situation, the only reason why I got my place is due to them telling the real-estate that they guarantee my income... My rent is $460 a week and I have 2 other people moving in with me soon to pay rent (in a month or 2)  I had to pull out another loan for emergencies which I may not talk about and in total my debts are;  -$10000 personal -$7000 vehicle -$2100 afterpay  My work has decided they don't wish to pay me for my services and have cut my hours by about 25 a week leaving me with $455 after tax, my loan repayment is $115 a week and my after current is $500 for the next 2 weeks, after that they are $200 or less  I am left with nothing after each payday and having to rely on my partner to help me with my payments???

reddit,How to get out of this loop of loans?,personalfinance,2024-09-10 02:14:43,"Hello,   Created an account so I could get some help as I know a lot of people turn to reddit. I am looking to find guidance on getting rid of my situation of never ending loop.   Back a year or so ago I stupidly as some do got payday loans (3) to be exact.   With these loans and getting behind on housing I am never ending loop with negative money every month. But I know if I could get these debts paid off than I would be back to normal less stress living.  Here is breakdown of what I got going on.    Paychecks(2) per month - biweekly: $4k/month  Expenses:   This is my hardest one to fix Payday loan (1): $675/Month 325.00% APR (I know, its dumb, I am dumb) $2600 remaining total      Payday Loan (2): $170/month (Payment Plan no additional interest rate) $1500 remaining total   Payday Loan (3): $370/month (Payment Plan no additional interest rate) $3500 remaining total   Housing: $1000/month   Utilities: $150/month   Wi-Fi: $60/month   Food: $300/month   Other Random Stuff I run into necessities usually : $100/month   Zip Trader: $500/month but will be done by end of September    Total Expenses: $3,325     With that being said I can never just get caught up because I am never actually able to reduce Payday Loan (1) total because of interest so its just a loop of me throwing $700 a month away and stuck. I have a loan from Fidelity that is $1900. If I got that paid off I could withdraw another Loan (Don't want to) for 6k but would have much lower interest rate and could pay off Payday Loans, but it would take at this rate like 6 months to get enough to even do that, not including other life things thrown my way. Just need someone with good guidance or who has been through this to try to lead me in a good direction. I have no family that can help me and I've seen stuff like national debt relief and such but heard they are scams. Also, my Credit is terrible used to be good before all this but is not bad.

reddit,I’m not sure how to get myself caught up up on my finances,personalfinance,2024-10-07 21:55:56,"I (25f) work full time but I don’t have a set schedule so it’s hard to get a second job. In May I financed my first car and with that my bills went up by about $500 and at the same time I had some personal expenses come up that totaled around the same amount. Thus, I have been behind in my bills by about $500 since May. I have been able to make ends meet using things like Earnin but payday loans are just slowly making the gap bigger and bigger. I want to get caught up so that I can get back to enjoying life. This has taken a huge toll on my mental health, and it seems impossible to even come close to breaking even at the end of the day. I haven’t been able to qualify for any credit cards or loans because I just took out the loan for the car and because I have a credit card that I maxed out and have only been able to make the minimum payment on because of all this mess.  What can I do to get caught up? I’ve cut all of my extra expenses so the only time I’m spending money outside of bills is the necessities like gas, cat food/ litter, bathroom supplies, etc. and I basically only go to the dollar store to get them.  My mom suggested trying to get a loan for around $3000, putting half away to give me a head start on payments, and use the other half to catch up/ get ahead in bills, but as I said I haven’t been able to get approved for anything. Google just says to ask friends and family or apply for loans or credit or get a second job, which as I’ve previously laid out aren’t really options for me, so I haven’t come to Reddit. How can I get out of this?   TLDR: I work full time with an unset schedule and am about $500 behind in bills. How can I get caught up that isn’t a loan, credit card, or second job?",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1fyjube/im_not_sure_how_to_get_myself_caught_up_up_on_my/,predatory

The email, mailing address, and bank account information (all he had was the bank name, not account number or anything else) related to the debt was also all old information, and I would not even have had access to the email address at the supposed time of the loan to sign any documents or anything (old college email address). He was threatening that he had already gotten my mailing address from the DA and would be mailing me paperwork relating to the debt and an order would be placed to freeze all my assets. The initial red flag was that the 800 number did not come up with anything on a Google search and that he was refusing to confirm specific details with me.

My situation is: I own nothing (but a business, in debt), have no savings, been self employed my whole life, no investments, no insurance.  I'd rather get out of debt than save/invest, even though I don't have an emergency fund. Obviously I'll pay the pay day loan off first, then the credit cards, but should I pay the business card off first and then the secured card? Interest rates are similar. Should I pay the sports off? Or just go with the monthly? Price won't change, interest was included when I took the payment plan option  I'm thinking the car should be next. Close to 20% interest, 3 years of payments left @ $296 (I pay $150/2x mo), still upside down need a new transmission. I was told $2700 almost 2 yrs ago, but it's still very driveable in manual. I'm not sure if I should continue to make payments first and get repairs, pay off the difference and refinance (my score is better than when I first purchased, but still bad) or just pay it off, then get repairs, and I still need to get insurance back on it.   Should I attempt to pay down the loans next? Or start a savings? Interest is around 2% thru the SBA, for the business loan or should I try to pay for school as I go? And should I do this with loans or on a payment plan? (Unsure of what these will be, might go to tech school if the state school waitlist is to long). I haven't talked to my new job yet for details, but they offer tuition reimbursement; I haven't found a scholarship I qualify for yet as I have no degree but about 90 credits, and currently not enrolled.

I feel like I included everything I needed to.

Using a throwaway since some people know my main.  I was a dumb 20 something and racked up enough debt that I was living ""on the edge"" so to speak and making just enough to pay minimums. I got a career and that all was good and just made bad decisions and hit with bad luck. Inflation made the living on the edge switch to being unable to survive. I'm 30 for reference now. I fell ill towards the end of the school year and throughout the summer and am barely recovered, so that lead to starting to slip financially and it just snowballed from there. I'm now -900 on my current bills due to being so far behind so I'm trying to logically catch up while not completely tanking my credit.  My career is low paying (public school teacher), I've taken on a second job already and work 11 hours a day on weekdays.  I have 11 credit cards, 2 loans, car payment, rent, utilities.  I'm currently unable to pay my credit card minimum payment. I tried doing a side gig to make up enough money, I sold some stuff, I did everything I could to make money. Was denied all loans, I'm afraid to take out a payday loan, I've had 100% payment history and it's the only thing keeping my credit score decent since my credit utilization is at 83%.  So here's where my advice is needed.  I have enough to pay all my necessities (rent, utilities, car). How should I spread the remaining funds? Should I make minimums on 3 cards and just not pay the rest until I can catch up? Or should I pay an equal amount across cards just to not fall further behind? Which debt should I prioritize? I'm currently 20 days behind on my payments so I've not yet hit the 30 day reporting threshold.  I've reached out to all my creditors and none will work with me. I'm trying to prevent a full tank of my credit score to an unrecoverable level.  I feel like a failure and I've got no family to lean on, no loans to take out, and I'm burning out so fast from the insane hours and work load and falling into a deep depression.  Sorry if this is too much for the sub but this place seems like the best place to start. Thank you all.

reddit,"Help filling out W4 - I need a % withheld, not $ amount",personalfinance,2024-07-10 21:09:19,"I know this question has come up before, but my situation is somewhat unique. The answers to previous questions are always ""use the calculator"" for ""accurate"" withholding. This does not help my situation.   I freelance. I jump around a lot and work multiple jobs. I can have one job that suddenly pays me a lot of money, followed by months of just getting by. I have a regular job that is intermittent, part-time employment and issues a W-2. Most of my other work is self-employment income, but that income is not always predictable or guaranteed, and can arrive suddenly in a large lump sum. Other years a big payday doesn't come and my W2 job is the bulk of my income. Currently, no matter how I fill out my W4 for my one W2-generating job, zero is taken out for withholding. I want to change this.   It does me no good to work in dollar amounts -- I don't want to put a dollar amount in ""extra withholding,"" because my W-2 paycheck fluctuates. An amount that would represent 10% of one of my big checks would eat up a large portion of one of my smaller checks - because my job is intermittent part-time and the hours fluctuate from pay period to pay period. Entering a dollar amount is unworkable. I want payroll to take 10 - 15% of every check, and in order to get them to do this, I need to figure out how to game the system.  On the old W-4 forms I could simply put ""0"" on line 5 - the total number of allowances I was claiming - and I would always get an amount taken out of my paycheck that worked out about right.  I don't mind taking home *less* money. I don't mind giving the government an interest-free loan. Please spare me from any advice containing these phrases. I would rather protect myself from an exorbitant tax bill at years end in the event I suddenly make enough money to jump tax brackets and end up with severely underfunded withholding. This has happened to me in the past. I then was required to pay estimated tax the following year when I did not make as much money, returned to the lower tax bracket, and got all my estimated tax back at the end of the year when it would have been better to have had it in my pocket all year long. In that instance, the estimated tax payments were far more burdensome to me than if they had just withheld a percentage of each check from my W2 job.  The standard advice I have found by searching this sub does not apply to my situation. An income that fluctuates wildly from year to year, and is unpredictable, does not ""fit"" the IRS calculator. Can anyone tell me how I can basically game the 2024 W4 form in order to trigger an automatic 10-15% withholding from each paycheck?",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1e070yh/help_filling_out_w4_i_need_a_withheld_not_amount/,predatory

For years I had no debt and great credit with help from my parents but after leaving the military, I tripped and face planted into quite a bit of credit card debt.

USAA Card- $4,980, APR 22.15%  Capital One- $985, APR 28.24%  Target RedCard- $2,160, APR 22.90%  I'm considering a consolidation loan for reasons that are primarily psychological: I have AuDHD and while set amounts of money that are owed and need to be paid back over a set period of time are simple for me to wrap my head around and handle, I find myself viewing any money I pay off of my credit cards as available for me to spend, causing me to lose ground between small purchases and interest. While I know that the amount of debt I have is comparatively small, it feels insurmountable because it feels so amorphous.   I know the key would be to maintain the same amount of credit; in other words, not pay off the cards, have a loan of the same amount that I currently owe, and then just run them up again. But once I have a credit card paid down, I'm good at keeping it down. I have an Ulta card that I've had paid off for years; whenever I use it, I pay the total off my next paycheck. I don't use the cards I have for big purchases: mostly just gas or cat food if I run low too close to payday or an autopayment coming out.  I don't know how much of this is needed info and how much of this is cope. I just want to be debt free as soon as possible, so that I can be the kind of person I want to be.

reddit,Accidentally double paid two bills. Might go negative in bank account.,personalfinance,2024-08-26 10:04:13,Basically most of my bills are paid automatically through my checking account or my credit card. My credit card expired online so two of my bills didn't autopay and I didn't realize it. I paid it with my checking and fixed my card info. The bills then went through on my credit card which is already set for autopay.  So I'm paying like 4 bills at once on top of my credit card payment.

reddit,I feel like my relationship with money needs a lot of improvement. ,personalfinance,2024-09-10 19:18:17,"Hey all, posted this on r/money as well.   I just turned 30 and it’s making me really want to change up my money habits and my mental attitude around finances. I don’t really take money all that seriously, and it feels like that’s starting to cause me more stress than anything.   I struggle with budgeting, and struggle with saving. I didn’t get taught any skills with these things so I’ve kinda just been winging it ever since I’ve been on my own. Money to me is something that simultaneously makes me feel in control (when I spend it) and out of control (also when I spend it, but mostly when I don’t have it)   There’s a lot of emphasis on financial subreddits about getting the most out of every single dollar and that really stresses me out. I want to be able to pay my bills and have money leftover and stop being broke until my next payday. I want to have the willpower to not spend like it’s burning a hole in my pocket.   I make a little over 50k a year, I don’t have a house or kids or a spouse. I have credit card and student loan debt. I want to have an emergency fund and pay down my debt. The thought of living like a pauper and pinching pennies makes me feel like an anxious little girl again - we grew up pretty tight on cash and didn’t have a lot of room for mistakes and do-overs, so I sorta grew up with a perfectionist mindset.  Any tips on how to approach money in a healthy way? How to change my mindset around spending and saving?  How do I build a healthy financial situation for myself?

Important information: *I have a disability that keeps me from working full time, I work 50 hours every 2 weeks at about $17 an hour all USA. I pay $180 in health/dental insurance every paycheck and I can not go lower than this with my work insurance*    Hi! So to begin with I’m 23, I have a decent job and I am finally in a place where I’m working consistently.   While working on getting disability filed with my work, I was out 2 weeks. I used what was basically a payday loan with my bank. I’m supposed to make about $800 (before insurance and tax) every 2 weeks. I end up with around $500 in my paycheck before the payday loan. After the loan, I end out with around $350.   I pay $150 in rent one paycheck and $150 in various bills the next paycheck. ($3 for Hulu, $10 for internet, $100 in car insurance, $4 for internet on switch, and $14 for Spotify) which leaves me with like $200. And there are 3 people living in my house, only me and my partner are able to contribute (taking care of my mom who’s disabled does help with rent, which keeps it so low. And she gets some food stamps but that’s for her food she will need throughout the month.)   Me and him spend about $100 a piece on food every 2 weeks.   I feel like I’m left with pennys, I can’t save and when something happens, we have no money put up. And my partners bills go to the same thing as me pretty much, his own bills and then rent/lights.  We are going through some pretty horrible things right now, within the home and just in general. And these big expenses are coming left and right. I also have over $2000 in debt from various financial issues like health, losing my job during covid and taking out a credit card, and other stuff in the past.   I’m really not sure how to get ahead, I don’t want to cut out the few expenses in my life that are worth keeping (literally just Spotify, Hulu, and switch internet.) and even if I did it would only be like $20 a month. I also feel like I have a decent grip on my spending habits and such. I really don’t know what I can do to get ahead. I know the obvious answers like “get a better job.” But it took me 2 years to get this work at home job that pays this decently that communicates well with my ADAAA.

reddit,How high of an interest rate would a debt have to be to warrant withdrawing from your 401(k)?,personalfinance,2024-07-18 20:05:46,"I understand if I have a payday loan with like 400% interest that I don't have a way to pay off other than withdrawing from my 401(k), I would obviously do that, but what's the cutoff and does it depend on the age of the person? Lifetime of the loan? And how different is the Math for withdrawing from Roth IRA?  Assume paying off the debt, you will now contribute all money that is making monthly payments to your debt instead towards 401(k) for the rest of the lifetime of the loan. It seems like for a 401(k) that if you're interest of the loan is higher than the interest rate you should expect to receive from the interest in your retirement account, then there is some length of time that eventually the better idea is to take the money from your account to avoid the debt. This is of course keeping in mind that the first year, you take out enough extra so that paying the additional income tax, and paying the 10% fee allow the amount you get in cash be the same.  For Instance, say your salary is 50000, and you expect to make an additional 4% each year. Your 401(k) is at 100k and you contribute 10% of your income to it. Your Retirement RoR is 7%. You take out a loan that is 10k at 9% over 60 months.  From my quick excel math (could be wrong) it seems like after 34 months, your 401(k) will have caught up had you not taken it out and contributed extra. (138,148.06 and 138,285.32). So you've effectively cut the amount of payments you needed to make in half. Am I missing something? Because I've always heard that you should never take from your 401(k). Is there a rough way to estimate whether or not your loan is worth it or tapping into your 401k is worth it? Because to me it seems like so many variables that you would have to calculate it out fully",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1e6kq6j/how_high_of_an_interest_rate_would_a_debt_have_to/,predatory

So my loan debts are Fairstone-$557 per month, TD loan-$476 per month, Easy Financial Loan-$404 per month, Cashmoney - $128 per month, and at the moment Icash payday loan $860 due this month, then my credit cards debts are Triangle- owing a total of $8000 maxed out, MBNA owing $930 credit limit is $1000, and TD owing $980 limit of $1000, then I have my regular monthly bills which are mortgage $774, Property tax $124, Condo fees $306, utilities $350, Phone bill for me and my teen $180, WIFI $200, childcare $88. I inquired about a CP back in April and was told because I own my house they couldnt get my payments any lower than $1300 per month, I backed out thinking thats still too high and I would lose my $500 overdraft limit in my bank, and also lose the ability to use payment plans for large purchases such as best buy and some shops (I use these for xmas shopping and more expensive items i need but cant afford up front. what also scared me away from agreeing to a CP was the fact that it stays on your credit and also having to cut all ties with current bank of which I have my sons education fund set up with as well as my life insurance. But really with the amount of debt I owe at the moment that overdraft limit is being eaten up by loan payments anyway wo really I guess losing that will make no real difference. I'm scheduled to speak with the LIT I spoke with back in April to see if I'd like to go ahead with a CP now and I'm just so on the fence. I've tried saving money, I've inquired about taking a line off my mortgage but because a family member is co signed on my house that is out of the question.

My mother never taught me how to save money and to this day, I never had more than $20 in my account and if I do, I spend it quickly. My mother’s motto was “If you have the money, spend it”  I mostly spend it on food or on others, I want to help people and I always want to pay for things. My mom said that people will feel more loved and appreciated if you get them gifts (i’m sure you can imagine how that affected me as a kid but that’s a different story lol)  Once I got to the age of being able to work, I just spent my paychecks, and when I received my first credit card, i maxed it out and am yet to fully pay it off. I grew up with things given to me and never learned to take care of myself.   Another thing is for my job, we have daily pay. After every shift we immediately get our money the next day from the shift- so when actual payday comes- I only have $10.  I have school loans to pay, but they’re all from a co-signer and I fall behind each month because I never have enough. And that affects them too and i know how serious that is.   I’ve tried so many things, savings account, pulling out cash and hiding it, putting money in jars- I just end up taking it and using it.   I want to be financially stable , and be able to move in with my boyfriend and go on trips and even have enough for gas. I want to be able to take care of unexpected fees too.

Six months later, my ex and I separated, and I moved into an apartment by myself back home in NY. Fortunately, my job allowed me to work remotely for a while.

However, having this car in a city with good public transportation has become a burden, and I feel trapped.

I'm hoping someone will have good advice for me on here on how to handle this. In my last post, I discussed how I got myself stuck in the payday loan trap and I owe about $200 that I cannot repay right now. It is now late, and because of the bills I had to pay yesterday, I have no money left in my account. Today, I woke up to my account being $-40. The lender is pretty much going to take out money from my account everyday until it is paid off for them, leaving me in the negatives. In my last post, I talked about how I only get paid about $150 every two weeks. I have an untraditional job, so I am getting compensated in other ways, but the $150 stays and will never change. I leave this job next week and start my new one the same week, but those funds probably won't hit until early-middle June, and I will be making significantly more. With what the lender is taking out of my account vs what I owe, my next paycheck in two weeks still will not completely get me out of the negatives. I also need to pay my credit card at the end of the month (which I do not have enough credit to get me through) still and buy other essentials the next coming days. I've put everything I can up for sale online, I've tried to get another cash advance just to pull me through (which is bad because that's how I got here, but I was not approved for any anyways), I've asked family and friends but no one can help me out. I've even gotten desperate enough to see if a random stranger online would lend me money and let me pay them back. I've tried to put signs up for dog walking or house cleaning, but nothing has worked there. I also still have to do my current job, train for my upcoming one, and finish schooling, so time is not on my side currently.   I'm taking advice from the last post and I'm not taking out a personal loan (I also browsed a couple and I'm not qualified for anything that's not shady).

reddit,In serious need of help with getting my financial act together. Where do I go for help?!,personalfinance,2024-05-15 17:13:50,"This post has the potential to be a bit long, so please bear with me...  A question I often ask myself is ""are there financial planners for people like me who don't have a ton of money and often barely make ends meet?"" So now, I guess I'm asking this sub. I don't know where to turn at this point in my life, which has been riddled with terrible financial decisions, bad luck, and family health issues.  About me: 39, male, USA. I work full-time for a health care company in Pennsylvania, making right around $88K yearly before taxes and deductions. My wife is unable to work due to a variety of health issues (both mental and physical), but does have a small Etsy shop that brings in an average of $300 on a good month. We have an unusually large family by today's standards -- 7 children ranging from 6 years old (twins) to 17. This is the part where people usually look at me like I have three heads, understandably so. Before my wife's health issues, she was a paramedic and in nursing school. So the plan was to eventually have two incomes once the kids were a bit older, but life didn't turn out that way. And before anyone asks, yes, we are done with having kids. I love them all more than life itself and would never imagine a world without them, but I am smart enough now to know that it would not have been this hard with fewer kids.  It's been very hard (nay, impossible) to get by on one income and a large family, even with some help from relatives along the way. But through it all, we have barely made it work, although I have shot my credit to hell and back in the process. My score hovers around 550 to 570 most of the time, but plummets pretty fast if I miss a payment on something.  Right now, high interest debt is my main issue. I have a variety of low-limit credit cards all maxed out (probably $5k total) a personal loan from OneMain Financial ($400 payment), an auto loan from Carvana/BridgeCrest ($508 payment, worst mistake of my life honestly but was in a desperate situation at the time), and student loans I've had to either defer or flat out stop paying. Other high expenses are groceries, obviously, but I do get $600 in SNAP benefits each month, car insurance at $250 per month because my wife has gotten into a few accidents the last 5 years, and of course rent, which is $1,900 since we need a 5-bedroom house for our large family. We used to own our home but were forced to sell in 2022 due to a variety of issues and our dire need to find a larger place to live for our growing kids.  Suffice to say, most months we either barely make ends meet, or don't at all. I sometimes have to rely on cash advance apps like MoneyLion and Earnin just to make it to the next payday. I have pretty much nothing in savings except for a very small ""retirement"" account, which is in quotes because I contribute 1% to it just to get my company match. I drained it a few years ago during an emergency that is too long of a story to tell here.  Everyone that I have talked to has said the same essential thing -- to look for a higher-paying job. While this is true, it's more complicated than that in reality. My current job (which I have been at for 1.5 years) affords me the flexibility to work from home most days, and understands that I need to care for my wife (who has substantial mental health issues) and kids and not be ""on"" 100% of the time. That is often more valuable than a higher salary, but I do know that I am capable and skilled enough in my field to eventually take a shot at a higher paying job.  So. What the heck do I do? Is there someone I can talk to about all this, who can give me real, practical advice? Would a credit union be able to help me with my high-interest debt yet terrible credit score/profile? Ideally, I would love to be able to consolidate all my debt into something more manageable. Is that even a possibility with my credit being bad? I get mail offers all the time saying I am ""pre-selected"" or pre-approved for a consolidation loan from some random company. I think these are all debt relief companies or possibly a scam, right? I am also severely underwater with our current vehicle as mentioned above. I owe probably 8k more than what it's worth right now, and the van is pretty much a lemon with how many problems it has.  Thank you for reading all this. I am a fairly positive person (I have to be, with the kids and taking care of my wife) but this feels pretty hopeless to me right now. I just wish I could hand over everything to someone who can manage my finances for me, and do the heavy lifting to get things under control.

reddit,Best friends business,personalfinance,2024-07-01 13:48:30,"Hi all, I was hoping to get some advice from people who have been in my position. I joined my best friends business in the UK 2 years ago and over that time we've grown slowly but steadily. We have always taken modest pay with 5 people employed in the beginning and are now sat at 11 employees.  We took on a project at the start of the year that we knew was a massive risk but felt we were ready for it. Unfortunately, the client we took the job on for has consistently knocked us down on our application payments and we've been struggling to pay off our loans and staff since about April. Through friends and family loans, agreements with lenders and hard work we are barely hanging on by a thread.  We owe 25k to a loan company, 15k to friends and family, 6k to a wholesaler and about another 5k to things like agencies (£GBP).  When it comes to payday we are having to choose between paying the staff or paying the loans. Obviously the staff come first but we're being hit with fines for late payments which is just taking us back to square one, if not worse. That 25k needle isn't moving.  I've never seen my friend so desperate and it kills me. I'm doing all I can for him but I'm running out of ideas. Bankruptcy has been discussed but it's obviously a last resort.  Any advice is welcomed, TIA.",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1dstf5g/best_friends_business/,predatory
reddit,Overdraft Account or Pay Car Note Late?,personalfinance,2024-07-09 22:33:11,"So I took out a car loan the end of May and my car note is about $700. I had some money saved up so I didn’t really think I would have an issue paying a car note with the income and the bills I have. My savings wasn’t extravagant, but I figured if I looked for a second job, I could build my savings up and I’d be in a more comfortable position financially. Well now I regret not waiting a bit later because now I got hit with an emergency when my ac unit no longer worked and I had to pay about $4500 dollars to install a new one (and before anyone says the AC unit is not a necessity it should be noted the AC unit is an essential expense for me  because it is blazing hot where I live). But to get my point across I am now getting by paycheck-to-paycheck until I can get some extra income going and my savings up(I am still searching for something that will work with my current schedule). I am stuck deciding whether or not to overdraft my bank account by a little over 600 dollars to pay my car note that is due today or wait until next payday (which is in 2 days) to pay my car note. What would your advice be for a situation like this? ",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1dzfnmp/overdraft_account_or_pay_car_note_late/,predatory
reddit,How Should I Handle Small Debt at 21?,personalfinance,2024-05-16 22:19:01,"Hello, I am 21 years old and am in a bit of a financial situation. I have unfortunately fallen down the payday loan rabbithole, and have gotten myself into some trouble. I currently owe about $300, and I will need to pay my credit card in about 12 days. I would like to pay between $50-100 this month. However, I am not going to make enough to pay everything off. My paycheck is about $150 every two weeks. I am about to start another job where I will be making LOTS more money, but that will not start coming in for another few weeks. I'm wondering if I should take out a small personal loan to pay off the debts now and then be able to pay it off over the summer. However, I know there are not many places that give out small loans. I would probably want to get a $400-500 loan. My credit score is also not the best. I have a score below 600, so this also limits my options. My parents will not be able to help me, and they are unaware of my situation. I would like them to not be involved as possible. I was wondering if anyone had advice on how I should continue, and if I do get a loan, some possible places that I can go to for reliable service.",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1ctpkxk/how_should_i_handle_small_debt_at_21/,predatory

My dad had a real weird way of thinking And it ruined most of my childhood as a result of that as an adult I made really bad decisions hell after I was 11 I made bad decisions on and I've done really bad things and my dad has always somewhat got me out of it or giving me money I would go over to his house when he got older before he passed away and barely clean his house and he would give me $500 or $1,000 aweek or every two weeks. But even then I lived on my own or with my husband and my children but I have no concept of saving money it's like for a long time me and my husband went without anything and not much money and at that point my dad wasn't helping me because I was making bad decisions which at that point I was thinking was my father's fault but eventually I could see that he may have created it but the decisions were still my fault and that was something I'm eventually going to have to deal with. But now I'm 40 years old and I still can't save my money I spend it way faster than I get it I work practically just to drive and even this past week I got to Payday Loan because I couldn't afford to pay all my bills because money I owed out and now this paycheck I'm going to have to pay $700 my paycheck back That's not including my $500 car note or insurance or second insurance or phone bill.

reddit,Financial newbie trying to become more serious,personalfinance,2024-05-06 01:48:07,"I'm looking for advice as I've been lurking here for a bit now and am ready to take my finances more seriously. I feel like I'm getting a late start here as I wasted about 5-8 years of my life in a serious battle with my alcoholism. I'm coming up on 4 years sober and as my responsibilities have increased I've started budgeting seriously for the first time this year. Important info to know off the bat:  * I'm 31 with a wife a kid (and trying to have more) * My yearly earnings are $135K, wife contributes $10K from her part-time job as well * I have about $80K in equity in my home, but it is small and we need to move soon to both be closer to work and to have more space for the growing family. I have a killer 3.0% interest rate on my mortgage and my monthly payment is $1,400. * I have only started contributing to my 401K last year at 3%. I just bumped that up to 6%. * I own about 20% of a private company that I co-founded. Things are looking pretty good on that front and I hope to get a decent payday one day on that as we hope to be acquired one day (we're in the tech space). We've survived for 5 years and have grown well each year. There is no liquidity here though and I'd say we're early enough that the whole thing could fall apart so I'm trying not to rely too heavily on this venture. We have about 30 employees currently. * Two car payments, although one will be paid off in a couple months and the other is $447/month. * Student loans, about $9.5K remaining between me and my wife.  A little background on me: My family was not great with money and I don't want to end up in their financial situation in my old age. They essentially have no retirement and no plan. I need to move soon to a larger place, and I'm not looking forward to losing that interest rate. In addition to what I'm doing with the 401K, I've started buying these ETFs in these ratios (12% of each pay period):  * VTI - 60% * VXUS - 20% * BND - 20%  I have about 6 months of emergency money available. I am trying to keep a tight budget for the first time (starting at the end of last year) as I've just been kind of treading water here and I know I need to get my act together with investing and saving for retirement. On top of that, I'm anticipating spending about $1,000 more per month on the mortgage.  I have no financial advisor or anything to really talk through my finances that I trust. I thought I'd come here and see if anyone has any advice for my situation, if my plan is not going far enough, if I'm falling into any obvious traps. I'm feeling nervous and I just want to do right by my family and I feel stunted from my years of addiction.",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1cl7ha5/financial_newbie_trying_to_become_more_serious/,predatory
reddit,Opt-Out/Self-Block from Online Loans? ,personalfinance,2024-06-04 13:21:53,"Is there a way to formally opt-out or ""self-exclude"" from online offers for payday loans, or whatever you call all these small instant flat-fee loans? Like the ones where they give you $100 but then you auto pay it back in a week for $120? Also talking about actual payday advancement loans, and even the ones where it's more like $1000 and you pay it back in say, ten weekly autopay installments of $120 each or whatever. I know that there are official ways for gambling addicts to revoke themselves from being allowed to do online lottery or enter casinos, etc. That's where I first learned the term ""self-exclusion"". And the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau CFPB, via their government website, allows people to officially remove themselves from all ""pre-approval offers"" for things like credit cards and life insurance. But that's not the same thing as all these online things like SoFi, Upstart, Sezzle, Tyme, Wise, Best Egg, etc. I think they're called emergency loans? Or installment loans? Please tell me there's some way for a person to block themselves from this loan sharking stuff. Someone close to me is absolutely financially drowning in a cycle of this bullsh*t and although he's working on setting stuff up with a counseling agency like Greenpath, he really needs some way to stop compulsively accepting online loan offers in an endless cycle. It honestly seems comparable to a gambling addiction or something like that. The only info I can find is for something that Singapore has set up for their citizens, but we're needing something in the U.S. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/1d7x0qt/optoutselfblock_from_online_loans/,predatory
reddit,Help with credit score PLEASE,personalfinance,2024-05-29 23:27:38,"Okay so firstly, I live in Canada. I had a lot of debt with payday loans, the CRA, etc   Eventually I got overwhelmed with the debt, ranging around $10,000. In September of 2023, I decided to do a consumer trade proposal. They lowered my debt to around $7000 and I’ve been making ALL of my payments on time.  However, my credit score has dropped 200 points within the last 2 months and I’m freaking out. I don’t understand why it dropped SO MUCH in such a short amount of time, especially because I’ve been making EVERY payment ON TIME. I know signing up for a consumer trade proposal can drop your credit score but wouldn’t it have happened months ago?  I decided to look at my credit report, and I have 3 revolving accounts. I don’t understand what that means, I’ve tried googling it but I just ended up more confused. Shouldn’t the revolving accounts be in closed accounts?
