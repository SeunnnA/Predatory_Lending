IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT PROCEDURES FOR APPLYING FOR A LOAN – To help fight the funding of terrorism and money laundering activities, and to comply with Tribal law and the spirit of federal law requiring all financial institutions to obtain, verify and record information that identifies each person who applies for a loan, we will ask for your name, address, date of birth, and other information that will allow us to identify you. We may also ask for your driver’s license number or other identifying documents.

* Loan approval, and amounts are based on minimum income amounts, other credit criteria, and verification of the information you provide during the application process. Big Picture Loans, LLC (“Big Picture Loans®”) will run credit checks on all applicants and may review credit information from specialized credit bureaus. Big Picture Loans reviews and approves all loans on Tribal land at its office located at E23970 Pow Wow Trail, Watersmeet, MI 49969. If your application is verified and approved by 5:00 p.m. CST, you will generally receive an ACH deposit on the next Business Day. Business Day means Monday through Friday excluding all federal banking holidays. The loan documents and authorizations, including the loan agreement, depend on time-sensitive factors. Despite our best efforts, unavoidable delays in the review process can happen. If we are unable to verify your information within two Business Days after you submit your application, the loan documents and authorizations may need to be modified to accurately reflect certain payment disclosures, and you may be required to carefully review and submit new documents reflecting these changes.

** Returned payments, late payments, and non-payments may result in additional fees, charges, or collection activities pursuant to the terms of your loan agreement and as allowable under Tribal and applicable federal law.

The Benefits of Check City Loans

Spanish Version
5 Star Excellence award from Shopper Approved for collecting at least 100 5 star reviews
With a short-term loan from a reputable lender, you can avoid paying late, overdraft, over-the-limit, and reconnection fees. Avoiding these fees might even help protect your credit score from the negative impact these fees can have.

A payday advance also gives you access to fast cash, so you can take advantage of great sales or limited-time offers that you would otherwise miss if you waited until your next paycheck. 

‍

Great Customer Service
One of the primary aspects of the Check City Difference is impeccable customer service. We believe in treating our customers with respect and care. We want to foster healthy relationships with our communities and do whatever we can to help you and your family.

Frequently Asked Questions
What is a payday loan?
A payday loan is an advance on your next paycheck. You take out a small, short-term loan and repay it when you receive your next paycheck. By doing this you can get the funds you need from your next paycheck sooner.

Payday Loans should be used for short-term financial needs only, not as a long-term financial solution. If you are experiencing credit difficulties, we encourage you to seek credit counseling. Although we strive to assist every applicant, not all loan applications will be approved.

Check City holds the check until your next payday or some other date you specify and then cashes the check to repay the loan.

Is Check City a direct payday lender?
Yes! Check City is licensed and registered in each state where it operates and is the direct lender of your loan (with the exception of Texas where we are licensed as a Credit Service Organization. We service your loan through an affiliated short-term loan provider). That means if we approve your loan it will be issued and serviced by Check City. 

What is an ACH transaction?
ACH Transaction stands for an Automatic Clearing House Transaction. It is a method of electronically depositing or withdrawing funds from an account. If your paycheck is directly deposited into your account, it is done by ACH.

What do I need to bring?
Basic customer contact information (name, phone number, email address)
Proof of Income (paystub, awards letter, bank statement)
State or Federal ID 
Checking account
How much can I borrow?
Loan amounts are determined on an individual basis. Your credit limit will depend on a number of factors—like your monthly income, how much you’ve already borrowed, and other creditworthiness factors. 

Many states have limits on the loan amount you can borrow. For more information please check the Annual Percentage Rate Disclosure for your state.

What are the rates and terms?
The total cost of credit is always clearly outlined to you according to the Federal Truth in Lending Regulations. You will find all the information about the Annual Percentage Rate (APR), the finance charge, the interest rate, and the total amount you are required to repay in the terms and conditions of your loan agreement. 

Late fees, returned item/NSF fees, or ongoing interest may apply if you fail to pay your loan on time. 

We will not charge you hidden fees that are not fully disclosed in your loan agreement. Visit our rates and fees page for information about rates in your state.

Can I make a partial payment?
A borrower may make partial payments on the principal owed on the loan without incurring additional charges.

Can I pay off my loan early?
Yes, you can make prepayments and partial payments on a loan. 

If you decide you do not want your loan within 24 hours of being approved, you may rescind your loan at no charge as long as you return the loan proceeds in accordance with the terms listed in your loan agreement. 

We encourage you to reduce the principal of your loan by making early payments to potentially reduce the finance charges you may incur at refinance.

How do I pay the loan back?
There are several options for paying back your loan. You can pay in person, over the phone, with cash, or with a *debit card if you don’t want the check deposited. You can pay back the loan online through an automatic withdraw directly from your bank account.

*Certain conditions and restrictions may apply. Please contact a Customer Service Representative at (800) 404-0254 for details.

How long does it take to approve my loan and receive the funds?
Once you’ve filled out the application the loan approval process only takes a few minutes for an in-store loan application. Getting the loan approved and having cash in hand usually only takes about 15 minutes.

For an online loan application, you can expect your funds to drop into your account within one business day of being approved. Please see your loan disclosure for specific details.

Is it easy to get additional loans?
After successfully completing your first payday advance loan, additional loans are easy to request. Simply go back to any Check City location and request a new loan. 

We remind consumers that payday advances should be used for short-term financial needs only and not as a long-term financial solution. Consumers who are experiencing credit difficulties should seek credit counseling. In addition, some states require a cooling-off period between payday loans or otherwise restrict the frequent supply of payday loans to a consumer. 

For additional information regarding your state’s governance on cash advance loans please contact a Check City Customer Service Representative.

Online payday loan alternatives from CashNetUSA.
When people are in a pinch for fast funding, they may look for bad credit loans to address their needs. For example, they might seek a cash advance, no credit check loan, emergency loan, title loan or payday loan.

CashNetUSA doesn’t offer title loans or payday loans, but we do offer lines of credit and installment loans. And we can offer them without performing a hard credit check with any of the main credit bureaus. Instead, we conduct an alternative credit check that uses other sources of data such as Clarity. Because of this, applying with us will not affect your FICO® credit score.

Loans from CashNetUSA offer greater flexibility than payday loans. With our line of credit, you receive access to a set amount of funds that you can access as needed. With our installment loan, you receive a one-time lump sum that you repay gradually over time.

To learn if our funding options are available in your state, check out our Rates & Terms page.


Payday Loans vs. CashNetUSA’s Fast Funding Options
Payday Loan
What is it?
A short-term loan usually paid back on the customer’s next payday.
How much can you get?
Typically $50 – $500.
How do you repay?
Generally on the borrower’s next payday — within 2 - 4 weeks.
CashNetUSA
Installment Loan
What is it?
A longer-term loan repaid over a set number of scheduled payments.
How much can you get?
A few hundred to a few thousand dollars.
How do you repay?
In installments over 3 – 24 months
CashNetUSA
Line of Credit
What is it?
A revolving credit line that you can draw from as needed.
How much can you get?
Credit limits range up to $2,000.*
How do you repay?
You pay a minimum payment or more every billing cycle.

How do payday loans compare with installment loans?
Payday loans and installment loans both provide a lump sum of money. However, installment loans are repaid gradually in “installments,” while payday loans typically need to be repaid in a single payment.

Loan amounts and the length of the repayment period also differ. Installment loans almost always offer bigger amounts and longer repayment periods compared to payday loans.


How do payday loans compare with lines of credit?
Rather than getting one lump sum of money, a line of credit provides a specific amount of credit that can be withdrawn as needed. It's repaid based on what’s been borrowed.

There’s a minimum payment due for each billing cycle (based on outstanding principal and fees). Unlike payday loans, you can make partial payments over time, or repay in full to reduce interest. As you repay, the money becomes available to draw from again.

Can I get a loan with no credit check?
Some lenders can offer loans without performing a traditional credit check. Instead of determining creditworthiness from your traditional credit report, these lenders may verify your income, employment status and bank account information. Whether you can get a loan would then depend largely on those factors — especially having verifiable income to show you can repay the loan.

More commonly, lenders may perform a “soft credit check,” which is a credit check that doesn’t leave a hard credit inquiry on your FICO credit report. Here are some ways to improve your financial picture — regardless of if you’re able to get a loan with no credit check:

Build or repair your credit. By improving your credit history, you can qualify for better loans with lower interest rates in the future.

Explore government assistance programs. Some government programs offer financial assistance that may help you avoid high-interest loans.

Talk to a financial advisor. Find a free credit counselor or advisor that can help you explore other options and create a plan to manage your finances better.


What type of loan is easiest to get with bad credit?
When you have bad credit, getting approved for loans can be challenging, but some types of loans are easier to obtain than others.

Online Personal Loans

Some online lenders offer installment loans or lines of credit for borrowers with bad credit. These loans may provide longer and more flexible repayment structures, which can make them more manageable compared to payday loans.

Secured Loans

Secured loans are backed by collateral, which reduces the lender's risk. Those typically include title loans, secured credit cards, secured personal loans and home equity lines of credit.

Credit Union Loans

Credit unions often provide Payday Alternative Loans (PALs) — small, short-term loans with lower fees and interest rates compared to traditional payday loans.

Co-signed Loans

If you have a friend or family member with good credit who is willing to co-sign a loan, you may be able to qualify for a traditional personal loan despite bad credit.

Learn more about payday loan alternatives.
What are online payday loans?
Online payday loans are short-term, small-principal loans that you can apply for using your mobile device or computer — sometimes with no credit check. These online loans are often used to take care of unexpected expenses and are repaid upon a borrower’s next payday.

CashNetUSA offers alternatives to payday loans in the form of lines of credit and installment loans. For more information about what is available in your state, visit our Rates & Terms page.

What is the best payday loan alternative?
There are several payday loan alternatives that may be able to help you access cash without the financial risks that can come with payday loans. Keep in mind that the ""best"" loan option is the one that is best for the individual person.

Personal loans. Personal loans generally refer to installment loans, which often have lower interest rates and better terms compared to payday loans.

Credit card cash advances. If you already have a credit card, a cash advance can be a cheaper option than a payday loan. However, be cautious, as cash advances often come with high interest rates and additional fees.

Nonprofits or government assistance. Some nonprofit organizations or government programs offer emergency financial assistance or low-interest loans to help with unexpected expenses. These can be a good option if you need money for basic needs like housing, utilities or medical bills.

Borrowing from family or friends. While not ideal or possible for everyone, borrowing from family or friends can be a way to avoid interest and fees. Just be sure to set clear repayment terms to avoid straining relationships.

Where does CashNetUSA offer or arrange payday loan alternatives?

What’s the difference between a payday loan and a personal loan?
A payday loan is a form of personal loan. However personal loans commonly refer to installment loans. The main differences between payday loans and installment loans are the repayment periods and loan amounts. Normally, payday loans are issued for smaller dollar amounts than installment loans and are repaid with your next paycheck.

Installment loans, on the other hand, can be issued for larger amounts of money than payday loans, depending on the borrower, location and lender. The loan repayment term for an installment loan is also typically longer, which can range from a few months to a few years.

Does CashNetUSA offer same-day loans?
At CashNetUSA, we strive to provide a fast and hassle-free funding process. Customers are generally funded the same day if their online application receives approval before 1:00 p.m. CT Monday - Friday. Applications approved other times are generally funded the next business day.† The exact timing of receipt of funds depends on the customer's banking institution.

On secured advances I will pledge and grant a security interest under the provisions of the Uniform Commercial Code and under the terms of the Open-End Loan Agreement and Security Agreement in the personal property which was purchased with the advance or otherwise required to secure the advance. Collateral securing other loans with the Credit Union will also secure loans made under this agreement. Real Estate Loans are not covered by this cross collateral agreement.

I will write to the Credit Union as soon as possible. You must hear from me no later than 60 days after you sent me the first statement on which the error or problem appeared. I can telephone you, but doing so will not preserve my rights. In my letter, I will give you the following information: ●  My name and account number; ●  The dollar amount of the suspected error; ●  Describe the error and explain, if I can, why I believe there is an error. If I need more information, I will describe the item I am not sure about. MY RIGHTS AND YOUR RESPONSIBILITIES AFTER YOU RECEIVE MY WRITTEN NOTICE: You must acknowledge my letter within 30 days, unless you have corrected the error by then. Within 90 days, you must either correct the error or explain why you believe the statement was correct. After you receive my letter, you cannot try to collect any amount I question, or report me as delinquent. You can continue to send statements to me for the amount I question including finance charges, and you can apply any unpaid amount against my credit limit. I do not have to pay any questioned amount while you are investigating, but I am still obligated to pay the parts of my statement that are not in question. If you find that you have made a mistake on my statement, I will not have to pay any finance charges related to any questioned amount. If you didn’t make a mistake, I may have to pay finance charges, and I will have to make up any missed payments on the questioned amount. In either case, you will send me a statement of the amount I owe and the date that it is due. If I fail to pay the amount that you think I owe, you may report me as delinquent. However, if your explanation does not satisfy me and I write to you within 10 days telling you that I still refuse to pay, you must tell anyone you report me to that I have a question about my statement. And, you must tell me the name of anyone you reported me to. You must tell anyone you report me to that the matter has been settled between us when it finally is. If you don’t follow these rules, you can’t collect the first $50.00 of the questioned amount, even if my statement was correct.

-END LOAN AND SECURITY AGREEMENT IN THESE AGREEMENTS, THE WORDS “I,” “ME,” “MY” AND “MINE” WILL MEAN ALL PERSONS WHO COMPLETED A “CREDIT APPLICATION FOR ALL CREDIT”  OR ENDORSED THE LOAN PROCEEDS CHECK.  THE WORDS “YOU,” “YOUR” AND “YOURS” WILL MEAN THE CREDIT UNION. I agree to this Loan and Security Agreement and Disclosure Statement and any future amendments thereto, and promise to pay you all sums advanced under this agreement, plus a Finance Charge. LOAN AGREEMENT 1. Advances:  You will make loan advances to me.  I understand that all advances must be made for good purposes.  Advances shall be made at my request by means of check, loan draft, electronic transfer, deposit to my checking account, or other account designated by me. 2. Credit Limits:  Advances against my Instant Cash Loan Account will at no time, in total, exceed the limit as set forth to me.  Advances on secured loans will depend on the value of security offered at the time of each advance. 3. Payments:  The minimum monthly payment and due date on all Instant Cash Loan Advances is explained on the reverse side.  The minimum monthly payment and due date on all secured loan advances will be set and disclosed to me at the time each advance is made on the Loan Advance Request Voucher.  My minimum payment will not change unless I request additional advances or fail to keep my agreement.  I understand that my payments will first be applied to pay late charges or other charges, if any, finance charges, and then to my outstanding advance balances.  I may pay the credit balance in full or in part at any time without penalty.  Minimum monthly payments shall not be reduced even though the unpaid principal balance declines as payments are made.  I understand that payroll deductions are NOT a condition of this loan.  If the payroll deduction is not received in time to make a loan payment, or if the payroll deduction is insufficient to make a full payment, I understand that it is MY RESPONSIBILITY to make the loan payment each month when payment is due. 4. Computation of Finance Charge:  Finance Charges on each loan will be computed at the Daily Periodic Rate and Annual Percentage Rate shown on the then current “Schedule A” or Loan Advance Request Voucher. 5. Credit Insurance:  Credit life or credit disability insurance is not required as a condition of credit.  If I choose voluntary credit life and/or credit disability insurance, the premiums for such coverage will be added to my outstanding balance.  If I do not make any payment when due, you may at your option, cancel such coverage.  You may also have the option of paying the insurance premiums and adding them to my outstanding balance where they will be subject to the annual percentage rate disclosed. 6. Late Charges:  A late charge, as shown on the reverse side of this document, may be assessed on late payments.  In any event, interest is charged for each day a balance is outstanding.  Any payment that (A) delays or (B) accelerates the reduction of my account balance will (A) increase or (B) decrease the total interest cost on my account. 7. Default:  I will be in default if I fail to make any payment when due, fail to keep or perform any promise made to you or agreement with you, if any information I have furnished proves to have been false, if I die, become insolvent or file a bankruptcy case, or if a third party tries by legal process to take any of my property or money.  If I am in default then you may, at your option, and without notice to me, declare this account to be immediately due and payable.  I must pay to you at that time the total unpaid balance, as well as the Finance Charge to date.  I further agree to pay your costs of collection, including reasonable attorney’s fees.  The Finance Charges as described in paragraph 4 of this agreement shall be payable before and after any breach of the agreement. 8. Debtor Responsibility:  I promise to notify you of any change in my name, address, or employment.  I promise not to apply for a loan if I know there is a reasonable probability that I will be unable to repay my obligation according to the terms of the credit extension.  I promise to inform you of any new information which relates to my ability to repay my obligation.  I promise not to submit false or inaccurate information or willfully conceal information regarding my credit worthiness, credit standing or credit capacity. 9. General Pledge of Shares:  I pledge my shares and deposits in the Credit Union.  In case I default, you may apply these shares and deposits to the payment of all sums due at the time of default, including costs of collection and reasonable attorney’s fees.  No lien or right to impress a lien on shares and deposits shall apply to any of my shares which may be held in an “Individual Retirement Account” (IRA). 10. Termination:  I understand that you may terminate this Loan and Security Agreement under any of the following conditions:   (1) Upon adverse re-evaluation of my credit worthiness.  (2) If I should fail to meet the terms of this agreement.  (3) At my option, or your option, with good cause and upon written notice.  I understand that termination will not affect my obligation to pay the balance outstanding incurred prior to the notice. 11. Checking Overdraft Authorization:  (If applicable)  The checking account mentioned in this section is also governed by another agreement between you and me.  If this agreement conflicts with any of the provisions governing the checking account, the provisions of this agreement shall control.  If I have a checking account with you, I agree that whenever I (or anyone authorized to sign on my checking account) write a check which when posted to my checking account exceeds the balance in the account by one cent or more, the check shall constitute a request for an advance against my Instant Cash Loan Account in increments of $100.00 which will be sufficient to permit the Credit Union to pay such check.  Any advances so made shall be subjected to the terms of this agreement.  The amount of any advance approved by you shall be credited to my checking account as a deposit.  These provisions also apply should I overdraw my checking account by means of an Automated Teller Machine or other electronic means.  Deposits to my checking account made after a loan advance are not automatically credited back to my loan. 12. Additional Provisions: (1) I agree to provide you with a current financial statement if you so request and understand that no advance will be made until you have reviewed that financial statement. (2)  Each provision of this agreement must be considered as part of the total agreement, and cannot in any way be severed from it.  However, I also agree that should any part of this agreement be found invalid, it will in no way affect the remainder of this agreement. (3)  I acknowledge that I have received a copy of this Open-End Loan Agreement, and that I have fully read and understand all its terms and conditions. (4) My signing and endorsing any checks or drafts, issued under this agreement or my use of any money advanced under this agreement shows my acceptance of its terms and conditions. SECURITY AGREEMENT 1. I hereby grant to you a security interest according to the provisions of the Uniform Commercial Code in any property pledged as collateral under this agreement as described on my Loan Advance Request Voucher.  Unless it is household goods, as that term is defined in the Credit Practices Rule, or real estate that is my primary residence, this collateral also secures any other obligation I owe to you, regardless when such obligations are or were incurred. In addition, unless it is household goods, as that term is defined in the Credit Practices Rule, or real estate that is my primary residence, any propety       securing other loans I have with you will also secure advances made under this agreement. 2. The collateral will be kept at the address shown on my application and I will not change the location of, sell or transfer the collateral unless I have your prior written consent. 3. I promise that I own the collateral and that no one else has any interest in it or claim against it.  I agree not to sell or lease the collateral or to give it as collateral to anyone until the advance secured by the collateral has been paid. 4. I will pay all taxes, assessments, and liens against or attached to the collateral and I further agree to keep it in good condition and housed in a suitable shelter.  I agree to execute financing statements and security agreement amendments at your request and will defend the property against adverse third party claims.  I will not remove the collateral from the state of my residence as shown on my application unless I have your permission. 5. I will maintain insurance against loss by Fire, Theft, or Collision and Comprehensive Coverage on motor vehicles or other property in which you have a security interest.  This insurance may be obtained from any insurance broker of my choice.  This insurance will be in a form and an amount satisfactory to you.  I will supply you with proof of such insurance and have you named as loss payee until all sums owed to you and secured by this property are repaid.  If I fail to maintain such insurance, you may, but are not required to, obtain insurance of your own and the cost of such insurance may be added to my account.  At your option the cost of such insurance, shall be paid on demand or paid by way of increased payments over the term of the insurance policy.  This cost may bear interest at the contract rate until paid.  I further assign to you the right to receive the proceeds of any insurance on such property, and direct any insurer to pay those proceeds directly to you.  I authorize you to increase my payroll deduction to cover the cost of insurance if necessary.  I authorize you to endorse any check or draft provided as the proceeds of such insurance, and apply those proceeds to the sums owed to you.  I further authorize you to provide your insurance service center with the necessary information for verification of adequate coverage.  I acknowledge that insurance, or any extension thereof, placed by you is without benefit to me individually but is primarily for your protection. 6. You may meet all requirements for sending me a notice of any kind if you send it to me by means of United States mail, at my last given address. 7. Any additional advances made to me for the payment of taxes or assessments or liens of any kind, or premiums on authorized insurance and interest owing thereon shall also be secured by this agreement. 8. In return for the sums advanced, I grant you the authority to repossess and sell the collateral should I default in making my payments, or should I fail to discharge any liability I may have under this agreement, or should any statement I have made to you prove false.  In such case, you or your authorized representatives may enter the premises where the collateral is kept and take possession, without being liable for trespass and without legal process. 9. Unless I default, I may keep possession of the property (collateral) described and use it in any lawful manner consistent with this agreement or with the insurance policy on the collateral.  I understand that you have certain rights and legal remedies available to you under the Uniform Commercial Code and other applicable laws, and that you may use these rights to enforce payment if I default.  In that event, I will at your request, assemble the property (collateral) and make it available to you at a place of your choosing.  If you decide to waive any default, it will not constitute waiver of any other subsequent defaults. 10. You are hereby appointed as my irrevocable Attorney-in-fact, coupled with an interest, to perform any acts which you feel are necessary to protect the collateral and the security interest which this agreement creates. 11. If there is more than one borrower, our obligations under this agreement are joint and several, each being equally responsible to fulfill the terms of this agreement. 12. Should you feel at any time the security presented has diminished in value, or for any other reason feel that additional security is required, I agree to assign to you within 10 days whatever additional security you feel is necessary to protect yourself against possible loss. 13. I acknowledge that I have received a copy of the Open-End Security Agreement, that I have fully read, understand and agree to be bound by all its terms and conditions prior to my signing. 14. My signing and endorsing any checks or drafts issued under this agreement or my use of any money advanced under this agreement shows my acceptance of its terms and conditions. CHANGE OF TERMS We may change any term or condition of this Agreement at any time. Unless otherwise required by law to provide you with an advance notice of such change we will provide you with notice of the change in a manner we deem appropriate.

""Card"" means the Visa® credit card and any other access devices, duplicates, renewals, or substitutions, including convenience checks, the Credit Union issues to You. ""Account"" means the line of credit established by this Agreement and includes Your Card. SECURITY INTEREST If You give the Credit Union a specific pledge of shares by signing a separate pledge of shares, Your pledged shares will secure Your Account. You may not withdraw amounts that have been specifically pledged to secure Your Account until the Credit Union agrees to release all or part of the pledged amount. 1. USING YOUR ACCOUNT — By using the Account or keeping the Card, You agree to the terms of this Agreement. You agree to use Your Account in accordance with this Agreement. Your Account must only be used for lawful transactions. 2. CREDIT LIMIT — We may establish a credit limit as part of this Agreement, which You promise not to exceed. If You exceed the credit limit, You promise to repay immediately the amount which exceeds the credit limit, including amounts due to finance charges, fees or other charges. You may request a credit limit increase on Your Account only by a method acceptable to the Credit Union. We may increase or decrease Your credit limit, refuse to make an advance and/or terminate Your Account at any time for any reason permitted by law. 3. CONVENIENCE CHECKS — We may, from time to time, issue convenience checks to You that may be drawn on Your Account. Convenience checks may not be used to make a payment on Your Account. If You use a convenience check, it will be posted to Your Account as a cash advance. We reserve the right to refuse to pay a convenience check drawn on Your Account for any reason and such refusal shall not constitute wrongful dishonor. You may request that We stop the payment of a convenience check drawn on Your Account. You agree to pay any fee as identified in this Agreement imposed to stop a payment on a convenience check issued on Your Account. You may make a stop payment request orally, if permitted, or in writing. Your request must be made with sufficient time in advance of the presentment of the check for payment to give Us a reasonable opportunity to act on Your request. In addition, Your request must accurately describe the check including the exact Account number, the payee, any check number that may be applicable, and the exact amount of the check. If permitted, You may make a stop payment request orally but such a request will expire after 14 days unless You confirm Your request in writing within that time. Written stop payment orders are effective only for six months and may be renewed for additional six month periods by requesting in writing that the stop payment order be renewed. We are not required to notify You when a stop payment order expires. If We re-credit Your Account after paying a check over a valid and timely stop payment order, You agree to sign a statement describing the dispute with the payee, to assign to Us all of Your rights against the payee or other holders of the check and to assist Us in any legal action. You agree to indemnify and hold Us harmless from all costs and expenses, including attorney's fees, damages, or claims, related to Our honoring Your stop payment request or in failing to stop payment of an item as a result of incorrect information provided to Us or the giving of inadequate time to act upon a stop payment request. Note: A convenience check is not a check as that term is defined under the Uniform Commercial Code. It is an advance from Your credit card Account with Us and Your stop payment rights are provided under this Agreement with Us.

4. REPAYMENT — You promise to repay all amounts You owe under this Agreement. Your promise to repay includes all transactions made to Your Account by You or anyone You authorize to use Your Account as well as all interest charges and fees. For each billing period, You must pay at least the Minimum Payment Due by the Payment Due Date. The Minimum Payment Due is 2.00% of Your total New Balance, or $20.00, whichever is greater, plus any amount past due and any amount by which You have exceeded Your applicable credit limit. If Your total New Balance is less than $20.00, then Your Minimum Payment Due is the amount of the total New Balance. You may pay more frequently, pay more than the Minimum Payment Due or pay the total New Balance in full. If You make extra or larger payments, You are still required to make at least the Minimum Payment Due each month Your Account has a balance (other than a credit balance). The Credit Union may delay replenishing Your credit limit until the date the payment is posted or the Credit Union confirms the payment has cleared. Your payment of the required Minimum Payment Due may be applied to what You owe the Credit Union in any manner the Credit Union chooses, as permitted by applicable law. If You make a payment in excess of the required Minimum Payment Due, the Credit Union will allocate the excess amount first to the balance with the highest annual percentage rate (“APR”) and any remaining portion to the other balances in descending order based on applicable APR, unless otherwise prescribed by applicable law. We may accept checks marked ""payment in full"" or with words of similar effect without losing any of Our rights to collect the full balance of Your Account with Us. 5. INTEREST AND FINANCE CHARGES — We will begin charging You interest on purchases on the date the transaction is posted to Your Account. We will begin charging You interest on cash advances and balance transfers on the date of the transaction. However, We will not charge You any interest on new purchases if Your Account had a zero or credit balance at the beginning of that billing cycle, or You paid the entire new balance on the previous cycle's billing statement by the Payment Due Date of that statement. To avoid an additional finance charge on the balance of purchases, You must pay the entire new balance on the billing statement by the Payment Due Date of that statement. If You are permitted to obtain cash advances on Your Account, purchases of instruments, and transactions that We consider the equivalent of cash will be posted to Your Account as cash advances, including, but not limited to, wire transfers, money orders, bets, lottery tickets, casino gaming chips, and cryptocurrency. How We Calculate Your Balance: Interest charges on Your Account are calculated separately for purchases, balance transfers and cash advances (“Transaction Type”). We figure the interest charge for each Transaction Type by applying the periodic rate to each corresponding “average daily balance.” To get the “average daily balance” for a Transaction Type We take the beginning balance for that Transaction Type each day, add any new transactions of that type, and subtract any unpaid interest or other finance charges and any applicable payments or credits. This gives Us the daily balance for each Transaction Type. Then, for each Transaction Type, We add up all the daily balances for the billing cycle and divide each total by the number of days in the billing cycle. This gives Us the “average daily balance” for each Transaction Type. 6. FEES — In addition to the periodic rate, additional fees may be imposed on Your Account. If applicable to Your Account, the fee amounts and explanations are disclosed on the Account Opening Disclosure accompanying this Agreement. 7. FOREIGN TRANSACTIONS — Purchases and cash advances made in foreign currencies will be debited from Your Account in U.S. dollars. The exchange rate between the transaction currency and the billing currency used for processing international transactions is a rate selected by Visa from a range of rates available in wholesale currency markets for the applicable central processing date, which rate may vary from the rate Visa itself receives or the government-mandated rate in effect for the applicable central processing date. The exchange rate used on the processing date may differ from the rate that would have been used on the purchase date or cardholder statement posting date. 8. AUTHORIZATIONS — We do not guarantee authorization of a transaction, either by Us or by a third party, even if You have sufficient credit available. You agree that We will not be liable for failing to give an authorization. We also reserve the right to limit the number of transactions that may be approved in one day. We reserve the right to deny certain transactions for any reason and at Our sole discretion, including for default, suspected fraudulent or unlawful activity, internet gambling or any indication of increased risk related to the transaction or the Account. You agree that We have no requirement to notify You of the specific reason We denied a transaction. If We detect unusual or suspicious activity, We may suspend Your credit privileges until We can verify the activity, or We may close the Account. 9. INFORMATION UPDATING SERVICE AND AUTHORIZATIONS — IfYou have authorized a merchant to bill charges to Your Card on a recurring basis, it is Your responsibility to notify the merchant in the event Your Card is replaced, Your Account information (such as Card number or expiration date) changes, or Your Account is closed. However, if Your Card is replaced or Your Account information changes, You authorize Us, without obligation on Our part, to provide the updated Account information to the merchant in order to permit the merchant to bill recurring charges to Your Card. You authorize Us to apply such recurring charges to Your Card until You notify Us that You have revoked authorization for the charges to Your Card.
Your Card is automatically enrolled in an information updating service. Through this service, Your updated Account information (such as Card number or expiration date) may be shared with participating merchants to facilitate continued recurring charges. Updates are not guaranteed before Your next payment to a merchant is due. You are responsible for making direct payment until recurring charges resume. To revoke Your authorization allowing Us to provide updated Account information to a merchant, please contact Us. 10. PREAUTHORIZED CHARGES — We may suspend preauthorized recurring charges with merchants if, for example, Your Card is lost or stolen, You default, or We change Your Account for any reason. If preauthorized recurring charges are suspended, You are responsible for making direct payment for such charges until You contact the merchant to reinstate recurring charges. 11. DEFAULT — You will be in default under this Agreement if You fail to pay the Minimum Payment Due by its Payment Due Date; pay by a check or similar instrument that is not honored or that We must return because it cannot be processed; pay by automatic debit that is returned unpaid; make any false or misleading statements in any credit application or credit update; file for bankruptcy; or die. You will also be in default if You fail to comply with the terms of this Agreement or any other Agreement You have with Us. If You default, We may close Your Account and require You to pay any unpaid balance immediately, subject to applicable law. In this Agreement and on Your Credit Card Application, You gave Us a security interest in all individual or joint share and/or deposit accounts with the Credit Union and authorized Us, if You defaulted, to apply the balance in these accounts to any amounts due. You agree We may rely on Your agreement and authorization to, upon Your default, apply any balance to any amounts due on Your Account. 12. LIABILITY FOR UNAUTHORIZED USE-LOST/STOLEN CARD NOTIFICATION — If You notice the loss or theft of Your credit card or a possible unauthorized use of Your Card, You should write to Us immediately at PO Box 67013, Harrisburg, PA, 17106 or call Us at (800) 237-7328 or (800) 556-5678, seven days a week 24 hours a day. You will not be liable for any unauthorized use that occurs after You notify Us. You may, however, be liable for unauthorized use that occurs before Your notice to Us.

The term “Credit Union” means United Trades Federal Credit Union. P.O. Box 2293 Tualatin, OR 97062 Ph: 503.283.5193 without getting specific approval for additional Line of Credit advances. If you overdraw a deposit account of yours, you agree we may treat that transaction as a request for an advance and your authorization to transfer funds to cover such overdraft.  1. Consumer Loan Documents   Under this Agreement you are establishing an ongoing Loan relationship with the Credit Union. You may request and receive Consumer Loans from time to time and you may establish a Personal Line of Credit account.  a. Consumer Loans. Each Consumer Loan that you request, and we approve from time to time will be considered a separate Loan transaction that is consummated at the time a Loan Advance Disclosure for each Loan is accepted by you. The terms applicable to your Consumer Loans will be governed by: (i) the Consumer Loan Application; (ii) this Agreement; (iii) the Loan Advance Disclosures provided with each Loan; (iv) a Loan proceeds check endorsement; and (v) other Loan documents required under this Agreement. These Loan documents are incorporated in and integrated as part of this Agreement.  b. Line of Credit. Upon your request and approval by the Credit Union, your Line of Credit will be established as an open-end, revolving Line of Credit. The terms applicable to your Line of Credit account will be governed by: (i) the Consumer Loan Application; (ii) this Agreement; (iii) the Line of Credit Account Disclosure provided at account opening; (iv) a Loan proceeds check endorsement; and (v) other Loan documents required under this Agreement. These Loan documents are incorporated in and integrated as part of this Agreement.  2. Accessing Your Loans & Line of Credit  If more than one person signs this Agreement or one of the Loan documents, your obligations under this Agreement, are joint and several. You and any co-applicant, jointly or alone, may request and receive Loan advances under this Agreement, to suspend further advances, or terminate this Agreement. You may request Loan advances in person, by mail, by telephone or electronic transfer service, or Loan draft to the extent applicable. The Credit Union may disburse Loan proceeds to you directly, to third parties, or to a deposit or share account of yours or any co-applicant in accordance with your instructions. a. Consumer Loan Advances. You may request and obtain one or more Consumer Loans from the Credit Union from time to time. You will receive a Loan Advance Disclosure at the time of each Loan which will contain specific disclosures regarding Loan amount, interest rate, fees, and security related to the particular advance. You may decline any Loan transaction after receiving the Advance Disclosure without obligation by notifying us within three days after receiving the Advance Disclosure and returning all Loan proceeds to us. However, once you have consummated the Loan transaction by retaining or using the Loan proceeds, you may no longer decline Loan the transaction.  b. Line of Credit Advances. You may request and obtain a Line of Credit account from the Credit Union. You will receive Line of Credit Account Disclosures at the time your account is opened which will contain specific disclosures regarding interest charges, fees, and terms related to the account. At the time of your initial Line of Credit advance, you will receive Personal Line of Credit Advance Disclosures which will contain specific disclosures regarding your approved credit limit, payment terms, and security related to the account. For a Line of Credit account, you may access credit on your account up to your approved credit limit, prepay any portion of the balance, and request subsequent advances from time to time without limitation, provided you are not in default. The approved credit limit for a Line of Credit account is the maximum amount you may draw upon at any time under that account 3. Payment Terms a. Promise to Pay. You promise to pay the Credit Union all Loan or Line of Credit advances, interest, fees and charges and other amounts due in accordance with this Agreement.  b. Payment Methods. You may make payments on your Consumer Loan or Line of Credit by automatic transfer from shares, payroll deduction, or by direct payment, as applicable. If you make automatic transfer payments, you are responsible for maintaining adequate funds in your account to satisfy your payments. If the Credit Union does not receive your payroll deduction, the Credit Union will not waive your payment requirement and you remain responsible for making timely payments. You may pay all or any portion of your account at any time without penalty, but any such prepayment will not relieve you of your obligation to make the required minimum payments. After your loans are paid, the Credit Union may deposit payroll deduction amounts to your share account unless otherwise notified.  c. Periodic Payments. For Consumer Loans, you agree to make the Periodic Payment as specified on the Loan Advance Disclosure by the due date specified by the Credit Union. In addition to the Periodic Payment, you agree to pay all amounts past due, including any late fees, immediately. For Line of Credit accounts, your Periodic Payment will equal 3% of the outstanding balance after the most recent advance, or $25, whichever is greater. d. Crediting Payments. Payments received at any office of the Credit Union prior to any posted transaction cutoff hours will be credited as of the day they are received and processed. Payments received after a transaction cutoff hour may not be credited until the next business day. All payments will be credited first to fees and charges, then to accrued interest, and finally to the outstanding principal balance of your Loan or Line of Credit. 4. Interest Charges a. When Interest Accrues. Each Consumer Loan or Line of Credit advance will accrue interest beginning on the date the advance is posted to your account. Interest will continue to accrue on your account until the entire outstanding balance is paid in full. Loan advances deposited to a deposit account will be subject to interest from the date of deposit even if the funds are not withdrawn immediately. b. How to Determine Interest. You will pay interest based on the unpaid principal balance of your Loan or Line of Credit. The unpaid principal balance is the outstanding account balance which remains unpaid at the close of business each day after all transactions for the day have been posted. The interest based on your unpaid principal balance is computed by multiplying that balance by a Periodic Rate and multiplying by the number of days since the last payment or credit. To get the Periodic Rate, we divide the interest rate by 365.  c. Interest Rate. The interest rate for each Loan will be set forth on the Loan Advance Disclosure. For Line of Credit accounts, the interest rate will be set forth on the Line of Credit Advance Disclosure. The Credit Union may change the rates it offers from time to time. If your loan is 40 days late or more we may increase the interest rate to 18% for as long as you are in default or six months, whichever is longer. You may request reduction of the rate after six months of timely payments. If payments have been made on time, during the six months review period, we may adjust the interest rate to its original rate or its original variable rate terms. 5. Fees and Charges   You agree to pay the fees and costs as set forth on the Loan Advance Disclosure provided with each Loan including any application fee. You May  2010  ▪  1 © 2010 Farleigh Wada Witt. All rights reserved. United Trades Federal Credit Union  Consumer Loan Agreem
agree to pay the fees and costs as set forth on the Line of Credit Account Disclosures. a. Late Fee. If any Loan payment is more than 15 days past due, you agree to pay a late charge of 20% of the past due interest, with a minimum of $25, and a maximum of $350. b. Returned Payment Fee. If any Loan payment is returned unpaid for any reason, you agree to pay a returned payment fee of $25. c. Transfer Fee. If we make an overdraft advance and transfer funds to a deposit account of yours, you agree to pay a $5 transfer fee. d. Collection Costs and Attorney Fees. If you are in default under the terms of this Agreement, you agree to pay the Credit Union’s costs in enforcing this Agreement and collecting any amounts you owe. The Credit Union’s costs include, to the extent permitted by applicable law, reasonable attorney fees if the Credit Union hires an attorney, and legal expenses incurred whether or not a lawsuit is commenced, plus any court costs and all other reasonable sums allowed by law. Attorney fees and legal expenses include those related to bankruptcy proceedings (including efforts to modify or vacate any automatic stay), trials, appeals, and any anticipated post-judgment collection actions. You agree that all collection costs and attorney fees incurred by the Credit Union are secured in accordance with this Agreement. e. Voluntary Payment Protection. We may offer Voluntary Payment Protection to you. Voluntary Payment Protection is not necessary to obtain credit. If you purchase Voluntary Payment Protection from us, you authorize us to add the fees or insurance charges monthly to your Loan balance and charge you interest to the entire balance. The rate used to determine the fees or insurance charges may change in the future. If the rate changes, we will provide any notices required by applicable law. 6.

Credit Union Actions   You agree the Credit Union may accept late payments and partial payments and can delay enforcing any of its rights under this Agreement without losing them. The Credit Union’s waiver of its rights in one instance does not constitute a waiver of its rights in other instances, or waiver of any other default. You agree the Credit Union may permit a modification, extension, or renewal of any term under this Agreement, or release or substitute collateral or any other person obligated for repayment of this Agreement or any guaranty, and you will remain liable for repayment of your Loan or Line of Credit. The Credit Union may exercise any of its rights under the security agreement and applicable law. In addition, the Credit Union may take other actions as follows: a. Suspension of Line of Credit Advances. The Credit Union may suspend your ability to draw upon a Line of Credit or use any access device or advance checks, without prior notice to you, under the following conditions:  (i) you are in default under this Agreement or any other agreement with the Credit Union; (ii) any credit verification indicates adverse information; (iii) any time the Credit Union reasonably determines the value of the collateral has declined; or (iv) you request a suspension of this account.  b.

The Credit Union may declare the entire balance of your loans immediately due, without prior notice.  c. Credit Union Lien/Security Interest. To the extent permitted by applicable law and to the extent of your indebtedness to the Credit Union, the Credit Union has a statutory lien on all your shares, deposits, and accumulated dividends or interest in all of your accounts at the Credit Union. In addition, you grant the Credit Union a security interest in all shares, deposits, and accumulated dividends or interest in all your accounts at the Credit Union, individual or joint, (except Individual Retirement Accounts). In the event that you fail to make any payments due to the Credit Union pursuant to the terms of this or any other agreement with the Credit Union, you authorize the Credit Union to immediately exercise its lien and apply the balance in these accounts to pay any indebtedness to the Credit Union, without further notice to you. d. Credit Verification. You agree to provide the Credit Union upon request at any time with current financial information, updated employment and credit information, or a new appraisal or valuation of collateral, as permitted by law. You understand that the Credit Union may record such information in its files and rely on it to make decisions about your account. You authorize the Credit Union at any time to release information to any credit bureau, merchant or other financial institution regarding the status and history of your account. 8. Security Agreement a. Security Interest. You grant the Credit Union a security interest, under the Uniform Commercial Code of the state in which the Credit Union is located, in all collateral described on any Loan Advance Disclosure or Line of Credit Account Disclosure received under this Agreement to secure your loans and Line of Credit account under this Agreement and all your other obligations (except those secured by a dwelling or real property) to the Credit Union. Collateral granted under this Agreement covers your past liabilities to the Credit Union and any liabilities that may arise in the future, regardless of form. These include, but are not limited to, loans for consumer purposes, liability which is sole or joint, absolute or contingent, primary or secondary, purchase money or non-purchase money, and liability under promissory notes, credit cards, open accounts, or overdrafts (but not loans secured by a dwelling or real property). The collateral includes accessions and additions installed in or affixed to the collateral and any proceeds of the collateral. All collateral securing this Loan will secure any extension, renewal, or modification of this Loan and all your other obligations. b. Maintenance. You agree that collateral securing this Loan will be for personal use and will not be used as a dwelling. Except for our security interest, you own the collateral free and clear. You will not allow any other liens on the collateral, even if they are junior to ours. You agree to maintain the collateral in good working order and repair any damage that affects its value. Except for vehicles, you agree to keep the collateral at your address of record, unless we tell you that you can move it. If the collateral is a vehicle, you will keep it at your present address, except for routine use, and you will not do anything that requires registering the vehicle in another state. You may move the collateral to your new address only if you give the Credit Union the new address in advance. You agree the Credit Union may come upon your premises and inspect the collateral at any reasonable time without notice. c. Insurance. You agree to keep the collateral insured with casualty and fire coverage satisfactory to the Credit Union, including an acceptable deductible. For vehicles, this means collision insurance and comprehensive insurance with a deductible amount acceptable to the 
Credit Union. You may provide this insurance through an existing policy or a new policy obtained from anyone you want that is acceptable to the Credit Union, and you agree to provide the Credit Union with proof of that coverage. You agree to name the Credit Union as loss payee. If you fail to pay any liens, buy or maintain insurance, or make repairs to the collateral, we may do so. You agree we may add any insurance or maintenance costs to the amount you owe under this Agreement and may adjust your monthly payments to pay the Loan over its originally scheduled term. The added amounts will bear interest at the rate charged under this Agreement. Insurance we purchase will cover only the Credit Union’s interest in the collateral and will not be liability insurance. This security provision also secures those amounts. You understand that all benefits paid by insurance that you or the Credit Union purchases, and any insurance refunds or rebates will be applied first to pay the Loan balance. WARNING - UNLESS YOU PROVIDE US WITH EVIDENCE OF THE INSURANCE COVERAGE AS REQUIRED BY OUR LOAN AGREEMENT, WE MAY PURCHASE INSURANCE AT YOUR EXPENSE TO PROTECT OUR INTEREST. THIS INSURANCE MAY, BUT NEED NOT, ALSO PROTECT YOUR INTEREST. IF THE COLLATERAL BECOMES DAMAGED, THE COVERAGE WE PURCHASE MAY NOT PAY ANY CLAIM YOU MAKE OR ANY CLAIM MADE AGAINST YOU. YOU MAY LATER CANCEL THIS COVERAGE BY PROVIDING EVIDENCE THAT YOU HAVE OBTAINED PROPER COVERAGE ELSEWHERE. YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE COST OF ANY INSURANCE PURCHASED BY US. THE COST OF THIS INSURANCE MAY BE ADDED TO YOUR LOAN BALANCE. IF THE COST IS ADDED TO THE LOAN BALANCE, THE INTEREST RATE ON THE UNDERLYING LOAN WILL APPLY TO THIS ADDED AMOUNT. THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF COVERAGE MAY BE THE DATE YOUR PRIOR COVERAGE LAPSED OR THE DATE YOU FAILED TO PROVIDE PROOF OF COVERAGE. THE COVERAGE WE PURCHASE MAY BE CONSIDERABLY MORE EXPENSIVE THAN INSURANCE YOU CAN OBTAIN ON YOUR OWN AND MAY NOT SATISFY ANY NEED FOR PROPERTY DAMAGE COVERAGE OR ANY APPLICABLE MANDATORY LIABILITY INSURANCE REQUIREMENTS. d. Sale of Collateral Upon Default. You may keep and use the collateral while this Agreement is not in default. If you are in default, we will have all of the rights of a secured party under the Uniform Commercial Code of the state in which the Credit Union is located, in addition to any other rights we may have. Upon request, you agree to make the collateral available to us at a place we designate. You authorize us to take possession of the collateral peaceably, with or without legal process, and sell it. If you are entitled to any notice required by applicable law, you agree that ten calendar days prior notice is enough. Unless you ask us in writing to give you notice at a different address, notice sent to you at your address of record will be sufficient. e. Additional Documents and Power of Attorney. You agree to sign any other documents, such as financing statements, applications for certificates of title, and certificates of title, to perfect our security interest. You agree to give us an irrevocable power of attorney to sign your name to title certificate(s) and to apply in your name for the issuance of a certificate or title to any motor vehicle you have given as collateral. To the extent permitted by applicable law, you agree we may endorse any check payable to you, if you refuse, and you waive protest of such action. 9.  Amendments.  To the extent permitted by applicable law, you agree the Credit Union may amend the terms of this Agreement from time to time. The Credit Union will notify you of any changes as required by law. Any notice of change in terms required by law will be sent to your address of record. You agree to inform the Credit Union in writing of your current address at all times. The Credit Union will consider this address your address of record. Notices will be mailed to you at the most recent address you have provided the Credit Union in writing. To the extent permitted by law, you agree that notice to any one borrower will be considered as giving notice to all borrowers. No oral statement by any Credit Union officer or employee is included in this Agreement, which may be modified only in writing. For Line of Credit Accounts, changes will apply to existing accounts to the extent set forth in the change in terms notice. For loans, changes will apply to new loans taken after the change becomes effective.  10. Applicable Law  You agree this Agreement will be governed by and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the State of Oregon. If any provision of this Agreement is invalid, the rest of the provisions shall remain valid.
